# üßõ ENHYPEN Data Analysis
Welcome to my project exploring ENHYPEN's album sales, online fan behaviour and Spotify popularity.

## ü©∏ Overview
This project contains : 
- Data collection from Circle Chart, Reddit, Spotify
- Data analysis and visualisations

You will find :
- notebooks/ 
  - ENHYPEN Data Project.ipynb : this is the main notebook where you will find analysis and visualisations
  - ENHA NLP.ipynb : this notebook has to be run in a Python 3.11 environment, since the huggingface libraries do not support the latest one yet (you will find all requirements in req_nlp.txt file). This notebook contains the sentiment analysis, and generates reddit_posts.csv file with the scores.
