**How the songs were selected:**

The songs were decided through a combination of [r/kpop's B-sides of 2024 TTT results](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1ibpdhs/rkpop_top_ten_tuesdays_results_your_top_bsides_of/), as well as the [songlist feedback survey we conducted on r/KpopRates!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoprates/comments/1k6108e/the_2024_in_bsides_rate_songlist_feedback_survey/).

---

Now, without further ado, let's introduce the 50 songs in the main rate (& the 5 songs in the bonus rate) that were selected for this rate, sorted by reverse alphabetical order:

#**Bonus Rate:**

The bonus rate is basically an extension of the main rate! It is a collection of host selections, as well as feedback survey favorites that couldn't quite make the main rate!

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not. Don't use commas (i.e ""8,8"") to separate your decimals!

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** - they are **optional but *HIGHLY* encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0). You can add them to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Stray Kids - I Like It: 2.1 I do not

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment.** Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* For this rate and most future rates, we have **a ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

**How the songs were selected:**

Only top-ranking songs from each rate (outside of [Best Of](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoprates/comments/z9sfph/rate_the_1st_kpop_subreddit_song_rate/) and [Music Videos Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoprates/comments/16kazij/rate_the_kpop_music_videos_rate/)) were considered for the rate, by nature of the theme. Japanese Songs Rate entries will be eligible for next All-Stars rate.

We have decided that artists can only get a max of 2 songs on one All-Stars Rate, to increase artist variety and diversity. Also every rate here will have a minimum of 3 songs in All-Stars (except for Pre-Debut LOONA due to artist limit), and a maximum of 4 songs.

---

Now, without further ado, let's introduce the 70 songs that were selected for this rate, ordered chronologically by rate date and their placement on said rate:

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not. Don't use commas (i.e ""8,8"") to separate your decimals!

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** - they are **optional but *HIGHLY* encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0). You can add them to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Sugarcoat (Natty Solo): 9.8 I won't sugarcoat it, she deserves her rightful crown

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment.** Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* You can also give a comment for each rate, like so: 

> Rate: 2019 in K-Pop: yeah, but where is the best song of 2019, Superhuman?

* For this rate and most future rates, we have **a ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

**How the songs were selected:**

We used the [/r/kpop Upcoming Monthly Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/archive) to comb through all K-Pop releases from the second half of the year. From there, we examined multiple factors: how many upvotes the MV received on r/kpop, how many Spotify streams a song has, how popular the artist is overall and on Reddit, overall balance, and several other factors. We also used the [r/kpop ""Best of 2024"" TTT results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LF7TGxxKaHBBk324N-nkEXleNVWSLc1MVSUC8JXkzqI/edit?usp=sharing) to gauge what songs Reddit preferred in 2024.

-----

Now, without further ado, let's introduce the 60 songs (and the 7 bonus songs) that were selected for this rate, ordered chronologically by release date:

#**Bonus Rate:**

The bonus rate is basically an extension of the main rate! It is a mixture of 'songs that came close to making the main rate' as well as some host selections!

**The Bonus Rate is optional** and **you do not have to submit a score for every song in the bonus list** if you do it: you can score none of them, all of them, or any number in between. **You cannot give a 0 or 11 to any song in the bonus,** as they are not part of the main rate. While it is optional, we hope you consider participating.

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not.

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** \- they are **optional but** ***HIGHLY*** **encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0).

* **Comments are encouraged and much appreciated** (but not required, except for if you give a 0) and can be added to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Cheeky Icy Thang: 9.6 Okay boomer

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment**. Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* For this rate and most future rates, we have a **ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

Yes they are both VERY handsome, but they seem so chill that I am just so curious what a conversation with them would be like. 

For the female idols, NMIXX's Sullyoon or IDLE's Soyeon. Sullyon because she seems so soft spoken that I just want to get to know her more. Soyeon because she's so outspoken that I just know she has great stories about being producing, being a woman in the field and just being an idol in general.",36,97
kpopthoughts,1lctx9y,2025-06-16 16:15:00,Korean vs international popularity - the trend has shifted/expanded,"I want to re-visit this topic - an interesting topic to me as a dinasour kpop fan (yup as early as 2000-ish) who used to watch MVs downloaded from p2p programme, Youtube was not yet bought by Google, literally lived in kpop forums before X/Twitter exists and before 1 million views is something we marveled and Spotify and iTunes are something I never used before. And yes, the time when kpop album sales went from 1+ million (1st gen) to 100-200k (2nd gen) and 100k is considered great achievement.


People used to discuss how ‘international popularity’ is not sustainable compared to ‘Korean popularity’. Now that social media like TikTok, X/Twitter and IG are huge marketing tool for kpop, Spotify/iTunes/Apple Music/Youtube Music existence and how kpop companies are getting international distributors especially in the US and Japan (I know Europe is still sketchy when it comes to local distribution), I feel like the shift is inevitable.


Looking at the trend, I feel like international popularity, even without Korean popularity is doable for a kpop group to sustain itself to even be very profitable and long-lasting. While international popularity may not translate well into Korean popularity (and similarly vice versa), I feel like we cannot belittle its importance in kpop anymore.


There are groups like Day6, QWER and The Boyz who has Korean popularity but has less impact internationally which is still great as they can do big concerts in Korea (Goyang Stadium/KSPO Dome), has great Korean streaming numbers and many Korean CFs. There are also groups like Stray Kids and Enhypen who have less Korean presence but have good sales and non-Korean streaming numbers. 


Of course in ideal world we would like to be popular both in Korea/internationally ala BTS/BP/NJ but now that kpop reach is closer due to the internet age and social media, international popularity is not something we can just scoff at. Interestingly, out of the groups that are relatively unpopular in Korea like SKZ can do KSPO Dome and stadium tour because of their international popularity. 


I feel like we now have come to an era that Korea, international or both popularity is something acceptable and as I said, groups can sustain and even be profitable with either or both types of popularity.


1st/2nd gen works differently as lots of idols shifted into becoming variety stars/actors/actresses and we have rare soloist like Taeyeon/GD who actually are quite successful. If you notice, starting 3rd gen the trend has shifted that there are still 3rd gen groups who are still actively promoting as a group eg Twice. 


And 4th gen starting with The Boyz/SKZ/Ateez/Idle who are still making music actively into their 7th year including touring. Group like SKZ is not even attempting to be in Korean variety nor acting even in their 7th year (2nd gen idols were already acting in their 2nd to 3rd year, it became very common, some even as soon as they debuted back then). Likely because there is no need as their music can sustain their career at this point of time.


That said, we are into 5th generation with lots of groups which have Korean attention so we shall see if the trend shifts again.

kpopthoughts,1l8debd,2025-06-11 01:11:42,What's the weirdest or strangest reason or way that made you stan a kpop group? (And sharing my experience too),"TW: Long Story

(Excuse my bad English if I said some confusing things lol)

Writing this so I can share my ""strange"" experience lmao.
So I recently got into Enhypen.

•A little backstory, you can skip it lol:
I've been listening to kpop since 2018 until now so I'm familiar with a lot of kpop groups and had joined and left various fandoms. I mostly listen to girl groups (I like IVE and I-dle the most) actually but I pretty much became devoted when I stan a bg (specifically bts). I do listen to some bg songs and added what i just like in my playlist but I  listen and enjoy to gg songs more.

The last time I stanned a bg is Bts but I turned into a casual listener now but I've been a strong fan of them for like more than 5 years before I left the fandom in mid 2023. They're the first kpop group I actually became very interested watching, not just from songs and performances but some shows of them too until Enhypen came lol.


•My discovery of Enhypen and turning into a lowkey Engene:
I've been familiar with Enhypen, Iland, and some of their popular songs (especially ""Polaroid Love"" & ""Fever"" when they became viral) since their debut but never had the interest to check out their songs or the group since maybe I'm too focused on my favorite groups that time. When I first listened to them, it's like back on late 2023 or early 2024 when I'm trying to listen to kpop groups outside of my fandoms or groups I mostly listen. I first listened to ""Given-Taken"" and liked it so I slowly started listening to more of their songs (just some though that appears on my feed), I was amazed by their choreography too since all of them are good dancers and I have some members I already have my eyes on already although it does not make me check more on their group.

I do listen to them time to time in 2024 and discovered more songs and learned some informatioms about the group since I became friends with a Kpop fan too that mainly stan Enhypen (maybe one of the reasons I got closer to discovering tje group too) but I never got fully into the group. 

So just recently in April, I started following Enhypen on their IG since I became interested of videos of Sunoo doing some Tiktok trends and found them cute. I found their videos pretty entertaining actually everytime they uploaded, but It's not the final nail to hit the coffin for me to make me stan them them. The reason why I find my way of finally stanning them ""strange"" is because of the ""Given-Taken"" instrumental, I do listen to instrumentals but i just do it occasionally when I'm curious enough. I don't remember exactly how I just randomly searched ""Given-Taken Instrumental"", probably because of my random curiosity lol. But I clicked on the first video that appeared, it's not actually an official instrumental from Enhypen or Hybe but maybe from someone who used some vocal removing tool. I listened to it and there are some parts that you can still hear the vocals but they are very faint. The instrumental is actually good and made me love the song more, but what really got me is that when it reached the bridge part and when I first heard it I'm like "" Wait, what, repeat that again"" and I feel like I found some hidden treasure. In the bridge there's like a vocal part there that goes ""Ohhh"" with maybe vocal effects added into it (but I might be wrong) and it repeated twice in the bridge, I don't know if something just hypnotized me from that part or what's gotten into me that time but that part had me on hook for days or maybe a week. Like I can't stop listening to it, I go on to actually finding more versions and covers of the song and the instrumental just to listen to that part. Some does include that part and some does because maybe it's too subtle too, if I find one that does it, I feel so satisfied. I don't know how long that phase of me lasts but after that, I suddenly got more interested into Enhypen, I checked almost all of their songs and I actually found their discography solid. I don't know if it's because my like towards the group that influenced me to think that way or it's just their songs are just that good that made me love them with no skips, they also have strong memorable parts too and had amazing instrumentals where I can enjoy them without missing the vocals. I'm currently watching Iland (2020) and slowly trying to complete it before I go into their Enhypen contents lol like I'm reading series of a book in order, My bias is Jay who I actually least noticed at first and I found him funny and amazing too. I had trouble distinguishing their voices at first but the more I listen to them, the more I recognized their sounds individually. It's crazy how a freaking instrumental and a specific part of it lead me to finally get into a group I've overlooked for long but as long as I get here it's fine.

Now enough of my yapping, sharing a story like this is very random and new for me since I don't normally share experiences especially with strangers even to people I know unless I trust them enough haha. I wanna know if you have a similar experience to me when you got into a a group in a weird or strange way

kpopthoughts,1l3s7d0,2025-06-05 08:27:01,What were your thought on bad desire by enhypen?,Personally I really like it and I loved the visuals too. The whole album sounds great and I really liked helium a lot as well.  I think the mv was nice but some bits j think did look just little messy. But overall I really enjoyed the song and the album and I'm interested to see the live performances. The only thing I didn't like is how short the songs are. That was a little disappointing ,53,63
kpopthoughts,1l5izcg,2025-06-07 13:49:43,K-pop boys need to bring yearning and downbadism back,"So this post is inspired by a reel I came across on Instagram which was labelled something like ""Category: Yearning and desperate men in k-pop"" and it made me realize that k-pop boys bring their A-game when they're singing about yearning or how they're so downbad that they're screaming, crying and throwing up for their partners. Now these yearning songs can be anything ranging from ""you're my personal brand of heroine"", ""I am crazily in love with you"" or ""I know we have broken up but I love you so much please come back to me"". The reel mentioned many songs that are some of my most fav in k-pop and it made me want to look how many such songs I have in my own playlist. Honestly, k-pop bgs/male soloists need to bring this energy to the table more often coz it leads to some of the best songs ever made. These are some of the songs I found in my playlist that deliver peak yearning and down-bad energy:

1. Eyes, Nose, Lips: Taeyang
2. Ruby: Taeyong
3. I need U: BTS
4. I Don't Understand But I Love You: SVT
5. Moonstruck: Enhypen
6. Love Talk: WayV
7. Roses: Jaehyun
8. Slidin: Kai
9. Inception: Ateez
10. Mmh: Kai
11. Lovesong: TXT
12. Spider: Hoshi
13. Cry For Love: Baekhyun
14. Keep Me Up: B.I.
15. 24H: SVT
16. Call Me Baby: EXO
17. Lady Luck: EXO
18. Bambi: Baekhyun
19. Good To Me: SVT
20. Can We Go Back: NCT DJJ
21. Press Your Number: Taemin 
22. Overdose: EXO
23. Heart Attack: EXO
24. Losing You: Wonho
25. Waiting: Woodz
26. Criminal Love: Enhypen
27. Screen Time: Epik High ft Hoshi
28. Love 119: Riize
29. The Killa (I Belong To You): TXT
30. Gravity: EXO
31. Adore U: SVT (specifically the Vocal Team version because it is 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽)
32. Please don't: K.Will
33. Y Si Fuera Ella: Shinee
34. Bad Dream: EXO 
35. Brought the heat back: Enhypen 
36. Bite Me: Enhypen 
37. Resist (I Can't Get Away): TXT
38. Unconditional: Jaehyun
39. Tell Me (What is Love): D.O., Yoo Young Jin
40. Slave: Taemin

This list was so fun to make for me and made me realize that yearning and downbadism is really a theme that brings out great work from male k-pop artists. These are the songs that I found from my k-pop playlist, so if you guys have any song in mind that you think fits the theme and has not been mentioned here, feel free to recommend. ",436,181
kpopthoughts,1l5hkmz,2025-06-07 12:19:49,Remixes that you like as much or even more than the original versions,"Recently (2 months ago), I was obsessed with[ Come Over](https://youtu.be/-GetJ5lFebg?si=cTAKfP0JFVv0ffkX) by LE SSERAFIM. I like the song (yeah JUNGLE! + the choreo and styling are top-notch), but it felt kind of... unfinished, like something was lacking. Then I found the [Bossa nova remix](https://youtu.be/9bdC7iCA5ro?si=Q1h5tW0EeVD5MHT8). I listened to it so much that it started to become the official version for me. It's slowed down, so the song is literally longer, and the instrumental feels fuller and more satisfying?

Another example, which is even more personal since I like EDM, is [Sweet Venom](https://youtu.be/qedonJosQ3g?si=YJ-3-YxUjbf_pe3P) by ENHYPEN. I don't vibe with the song but the [SEEB remix](https://youtu.be/or-vBvcZaao?si=yF42KHtDnCgNZHhs) is one of my favourite song of that year. I also want to bring attention to the [Moon Kyoo remix ](https://youtu.be/9C4-EeudB7U?si=hIWGj_bNOabie4T1)of [INVU by TAEYEON](https://youtu.be/AbZH7XWDW_k?si=x872etmNOQBz3zi4) that makes the song even dreamier, and I love both versions as much.

I'll also mention unofficial remixes. The first one is actually a delayed version (which... who first had this idea, it's so random lol) but it's amazing how much it works for [Super Shy](https://youtu.be/wU2siJ2c5TA?si=ptwp75_Iuoq69Boh) by NEW JEANS. Again, [this version by zana](https://youtu.be/LGUUDM8SAGo?si=Evw38rHOxVNbRvbe) lengthens the song and surprisingly enhanced some parts.

Now [Sticker by NCT 127](https://youtu.be/1oYWnbTSang?si=Ew-ASiUsZLGdPZMS). Sorry to its defenders but I can't with the flute! However, this [version by loft](https://youtu.be/tIvcu_PRI1o?si=p-PX67CT6I2xFTVs) made it into my K-Pop playlist.

Bonus : it's been 5 years so new people wouldn't know of KAACHI (I won't explain, here is the [Your Turn MV](https://youtu.be/mX4d-lcxDyQ?si=YQd0wkZ17Tyf2rwq), see for yourself). It's not really a remix, but this [cover by Johnny](https://youtu.be/Jy4aaIluvcY?si=kmn3eAYypo_WSqmu) really shows how much production and vocal delivery matter. And what's even more interesting for someone like me who knows nothing about the making of music is that he made a [video explaining](https://youtu.be/WYwt1JjeUoI?si=3RpfKZbrZrkRWW-9) what he has fixed and why.",21,38
kpopthoughts,1l1xdb7,2025-06-03 01:42:50,Data on quantity and growth of K-pop fanfiction on AO3: Boy Group Edition,"I've been collecting some data over the last year over k-pop fanfiction being written and published on AO3, and wanted to share some of my data here to see what people think. My goal was to know which k-pop groups have the most fanfiction written about them, as well as which are currently growing the most.

I know that k-pop fanfiction can be a divisive topic, but we know that it's been a big part of k-pop fandom since the beginning and that the k-pop companies do track this as a measure of a group's popularity and fandom. An active fanfiction fandom can drive interest in a group. In any case, it's out there.

I'll be looking at what the top 10 groups are by three different metrics: first, the all-time number of fics; second, the number of fics written in the last 6 months; third, the percentage growth in the number of fics in the last 6 months. The first metric will show us which groups have accumulated the most fanfiction in the last 15 years that AO3 has been active, and the 2nd and 3rd metric will show us what groups people are writing fanfiction about right now. I went through all the groups with at least 100 fics published on AO3 and recorded the number of fics for each at two different dates: 11/23/24 and 5/31/25. Since most of the fanfiction on AO3 is romantic in genre, I also included the top pairing for each group. 

This post will cover the data on boy groups. I also have data on girl groups which I'll share in a follow-up post.

Some disclaimers:

* For those who don't know, AO3, short for Archive of our Own, is one of the big fanfiction hosting sites. Most of the content on it is written in English, so this data is generally representing fan writers writing in English, mostly from Western countries. Notably, Korean fans have their own diferent sites for posting fanfiction.
* However I did notice that there are a substantial number of fics written in Chinese and Indonesian for some of these groups, so AO3 is spreading to some non-English writing communities.
* The most popular type of fic on AO3 involves pairing up members of the same group. Other big categories of fic, such as idol/reader fic, is more popular on other sites and so isn't well represented.
* AO3 groups all of NCT under one tag, so I can't get data on the units individually.

Now for the data:

**All-time most fanfics**

|Group|Debut year|Total # of fics|Top pairing|6 month % growth|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BTS|2013|232215|V/Jungkook|2.57%|
|Stray Kids|2018|85422|Han/Lee Know|12.26%|
|NCT|2016|76853|Mark/Haechan|4.47%|
|Seventeen|2015|59886|Wonwoo/Mingyu|10.93%|
|Exo|2012|52134|Baekhyun/Chanyeol|1.36%|
|Ateez|2018|35530|Hongjoong/Seonghwa|14.98%|
|TXT|2019|24850|Soobin/Yeonjun|10.13%|
|Enhypen|2020|20506|Sunoo/Sunghoon|17.10%|
|Got7|2014|15870|JB/Jinyoung|1.74%|
|Monsta X|2015|14210|I.M./Kihyun|0.94%|

* This list matches up well with the k-pop boy groups with the biggest Western fandoms.
* We can see that older groups have many accumulated fics but a slower growth rate, which younger groups are growing faster.
* Notably, in the last year Stray Kids took over NCT for 2nd place, Seventeen passed EXO for 4th, and Enhypen moved from 10th to 8th.
* AO3 wasn't as popular in the 2008-2012 time period, so groups from back then are underrepresented since fics about them were posted on other sites.

**Most fanfics added in the last 6 months**

|Group|Debut year|Fics added in 6 months|Top pairing|Total # of fics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Stray Kids|2018|9328|Han/Lee Know|85422|
|Seventeen|2015|5902|Wonwoo/Mingyu|59886|
|BTS|2013|5829|V/Jungkook|232215|
|Ateez|2018|4628|Hongjoong/Seonghwa|35530|
|NCT|2016|3191|Haechan/Mark|76853|
|Enhypen|2020|2994|Sunoo/Sunghoon|20506|
|Zerobaseone|2023|2812|Zhang Hao/Sung Hanbin|10613|
|TXT|2019|2285|Soobin/Yeonjun|24850|
|BoyNextDoor|2023|1256|Taesan/Jaehyun|2863|
|Plave|2023|1241|Banby/Eunho|3221|

* This list shows which groups had the most new fanfic posted in the last 6 months, which shows which fandoms are currently most active.
* We see a lot of the same groups here because the biggest fandoms will post the most, but the newer groups are a lot more dominant. We also see 3 very active 2023 groups join the list. 
* It's impressive that Seventeen places higher here than in the all-time most fics list given that they're 10 years old. 

**Highest Growth Rate**

|Group|Debut year|6 month growth rate|Top pairing|Total # of fics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|&Team|2022|132.51%|EJ/Nicholas|1781|
|TWS|2024|96.41%|Dohoon/Shinyu|493|
|BoyNextDoor|2023|78.16%|Taesan/Jaehyun|2863|
|Plave|2023|62.68%|Bamby/Eunho|3221|
|P1Harmony|2020|47.53%|Theo/Keeho|1462|
|Zerobaseone|2023|36.05%|Zhang Hao/Sung Hanbin|10613|
|Lucy|2020|34.25%|Sangyeop/Yechan|196|
|Riize|2023|31.20%|Sungchan/Shotaro|3234|
|Xdinary Heroes|2021|28.00%|Gaon/Jooyeon|2057|
|Omega X|2021|25.38%|Jaehan/Yechan|163|
|BigBang|2006|25.37%|TOP/G-Dragon|3415|

* This shows the top groups with at least 100 fics that grew the most in the last 6 months. I made it a top 11 because &Team is only half a k-pop group and because the 11th place is very interesting.
* This list is dominated by newer groups, especially ones that either just debuted or took a few years to establish their dynamic in a way that inspires fanfic writers. 
* The most interesting here is BigBang at #11. BigBang had a huge jump in fanfic posted in the last 6 months -- previously it was at 1% growth like other older fandoms. Most of the new fic is GD/TOP and a lot of it is in Chinese. The group members' recent activities must have brought out their fanfic writing fandom.
* The increase in Omega X fic is wholly due to one very prolific Chinese-language writer. 

Finally, there are two new groups that already have over 100 fics and so a technically infinite growth rate:

|Group|Debut year|Total # of fics|Top pairing|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AHOF|2025|260|JL/Park Han|
|XLOV|2025|116|Rui/Wumuti|

  
I hope you all enjoyed that! There's \~90 boy groups with >100 fics, so if there's any groups that weren't on top rankings that you'd like to know about, or other aspects of the data you're curious about, just ask! As I said, I also have the data for the equivalent post for girl groups which I will write up at a later date.",340,137

kpopthoughts,1kustn9,2025-05-25 05:12:47,"Story/lore in Ateez, Seventeen, Enhypen, StrayKids + more","I think almost everyone who knows Enhypen, knows that there's a long and deep story/lore connecting everything together, but recently I've been curious about other groups lore, like ateez, seventeen, stray kids, blackpink, &team and BTS

Enhypen lore follows the story of them as vampires, through different times and their unique powers. And connected to their webtoon. However I don't know the lore from start-present

BTS, I know many of their albums are connected but is there a main story line? What I know is that Love yourself series follows the concept of loving yourself and relationships, you never walk alone, is a message of hope for youth and facing hardships + spring day (Sewol ferry)

Ateez, seventeen, StrayKids, &team, and blackpink lore, I don't even know if there is a story, I'm sure there is but I'm not catching it if there is a story

Anyways I'm just curious if there is lore for these groups and what the lore is. I personally think Ateez, Enhypen and StrayKids have very interesting concepts in all of their comebacks",6,51
kpopthoughts,1krr8uj,2025-05-21 08:40:42,Enhypen Desire Unleashed has to be one of the coolest album rollouts - they released an actual escape game.,"I just have to talk about the album rollout for the new enhypen album because its actually insane. While I think Belift lacks in quite a few aspects, their creative team is unmatched.


Promotion started with the release of the new concept cinema. The concept cinema was done so well. The aesthetic and atmosphere are amazing, and the boys could show their improved acting skills.
Then we went on to the concept photos... I mean they are insane. All 4 versions look amazing and are high quality. 
And then today they released an actual escape game which can be played on pc/laptops (enhypenescape.com). The game was fun and the quality was good.

And the rollout continues later today with the tracklist and the album preview tomorrow. 

And then 2 weeks of nothing until the comeback? With all the random surprise drops we got, those two weeks are probably not empty, but we have absolutely no clue what's coming or when. There isn't even a teaser for the MV. The members have also been very cautious not to spoil anything, very suspicious... But to end it, I am very excited for whatever is coming and hats off to Enhypen and their team.",148,20
kpopthoughts,1kpn1or,2025-05-18 17:47:59,ILLIT and Enhypen comebacks feel like an art gallery,"As someone whose hobby is to go around mueums, Illit and Enhypen's comebacks reminds me of going around an art gallery. They remind me of exhibitions.


The photography, the lighting, the symbolism layered into their styling, films, and MVs all blow my mind. 


You can interpret them in so many ways because there's just so much to unpack. People are dissecting each photoshoot like it's a painting in a museum. The conversation can go on for weeks and fans can even find connections with literature, psychology, history or folklore.


I don't even know the full lore story of Illit and Enhypen but it doesn't matter. Their creative branding is so multi-layered and leaves room for your own imagination. There's always something to enjoy for the fandom, casuals, or just art lovers like me.


Tbh I don't care for Belift itself but their creative department deserves their flowers. Some of [these photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/UcuVaH1) look like actual paintings or cinematic stills. It just scratches that part of my brain that loves museums and discussing art.

kpopthoughts,1kqro44,2025-05-20 02:26:36,"As a YG group, why does TREASURE's impact feel so low?","I would like to preface: I only started getting into Kpop around 2023, and only got fully invested into the culture in 2024, so I lack a lot of cultural contexts!

Also this is totally not hate on Treasure! I like their music and am fairly interested in them as a group.

But I was wondering, when we see YG acts such as Blackpink, BigBang and BabyMonster having *huge* impact and popularity, in numbers, in the scene, in Korea and the West, I am very surprised that Treasure seems lost in the fray.

When we discuss 4th Gen BG leaders, most scrap over Stray Kids, TXT, Ateez and Enhypen. I never see anyone bring Treasure near the conversation. I know that leaders don't all have to be from big companies, but it seems peculiar.   
  
I rarely see Treasure stans too (emphasis on rarely, they crop up sometimes) - just the other day I had to search up what their fandom name was, because I had forgotten again.  
  
I normally learn a lot of Kpop group members via cultural osmosis of their names being brought up (ie. a lot of Seventeen, all of BabyMonster), but outside of compilation videos (those vids where it's like smash or pass kpop idols or smth), I only ever saw Hyunsuk's controversies (that bawk video), and recalled Yedam from the Stray Kids survival show (and he's not even there anymore). 

When we think of Treasure songs with high impact, I feel like I only learned of Jikjin and Darari naturally, the rest was my absolute obsession with boy group songs that I was actively searching them out. 

I know their numbers aren't that bad, it appears that Yellow did fairly okay, but no one was talking about it?

It appears at least their popularity in the West is really low. I assume this is mostly attributed to Hyunsuk's CA. 

Did they simply debut too late to cement themselves in the 4th gen? But Enhypen debuted after them, and lots of GG 4th gen leader candidates came very late (NewJeans, IVE, Le Sserafim), so that can't be it?

I've heard maybe some talk about their survival show/pre-debut being messy/squandered, so maybe that?

Did YG suck at promotion?

Did their music simply not mesh? 

OR is my social media algorithm just screwing with me and there are many western Treasure stans out there, waiting to be discovered in these replies? I'm super interested in your views on this?",106,124
kpopthoughts,1kpt9yr,2025-05-18 22:14:09,A Lot of K-Pop Groups Have Oversatured Themselves In The American Touring Market,"When it comes to conversations about K-pop groups tours not selling well, people like to point out 2 factors. Tickets being expensive and the economy, which are absolutely true. But another factor is that groups have oversatured themselves in the touring market. For example, groups like Ateez, TXT, Enhypen, P1Harmony and Dreamcatcher have toured here in America since Covid restrictions were lifted back in 2022. I wanna use Ateez as an example, they just announced yet another tour in America,and the problem is they literally here just last year. And I think that's why tickets are selling the way KQ would probably like them to sell. There's no reason for fans to rush and by tickets, because they just saw them in concert last year. I believe it's the reason why Stray Kids upcoming tour is doing so well, their last concert here in America for the Maniac Tour was April 2023, and their next show for the Dominate Tour is May 2025 in Seattle. You have to give your audience the opportunity to miss you, and I don't think that a lot of K-Pop companies understand that",476,156
kpopthoughts,1kkn78n,2025-05-12 10:13:14,"Stats about Kpop BG concerts and tours (location, attendance, etc.)","HI everyone, a new kpop stan (a year and a half) I like to understand things. For me stats are a great way to see the information.

After seeing a lot of information and debate about who is the biggest group, the most popular, ... I wanted to see what the number said.

Today the subject is concert and tours (as voted in my survey). Sorry it took a long time but compiling the stats was more difficult than I thought.

 

*Disclaimers :*

*1/ This is something I do to satisfy my curiosity and I don't pretend this is exhaustive nor perfect. I choose the groups based on popularity because it was a really long process and I don't have the time to beyond those groups*

*2/ In no way is this a attack or criticism against the groups that didn't visit X or Y country.*

*3/ This is a Boy Group version because this is taking me so much time and I wanted to post it quickly. I'll post the Girl Group version later if you're interested in it. As usual, I don't take into account solos concert or tours as I concentrate on groups.*

*4/ I choose to start at 3rd Gen groups because I didn't find a lot of reliable data on older groups and I even had difficulties for some 3rd Gen groups.*

*5/ It's not fully accurate because for a lot of dates I couldn't found attendance data or even capacity for some venues.*

*6/It can't be an exact comparison between groups because of the impact of COVID and the different age of each groups.*

 

My source are principally Wikipedia, [kpop.fandom.com](http://kpop.fandom.com/) and [touringdata.wordpress.com](http://touringdata.wordpress.com/)

 

**Some quick explanation about the numbers : On the excel all number in red are estimate either based on venue capacity, attendance on similar shows of the same tour or both. The number in black are attendance numbers quoted by sources.**

 

Groups studied for those statistic : EXO, Monsta X, GOT7, Seventeen, BTS, Stray Kids, Ateez, TXT, Enhypen, The Boyz and Treasure

 

Here is the link to the stats in details : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I3gFVwsFirDSo8fAhpsZzWthmHxvaChd6pt6dx5z3A8/edit?usp=drive\_link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I3gFVwsFirDSo8fAhpsZzWthmHxvaChd6pt6dx5z3A8/edit?usp=drive_link)

 

**Some of my conclusions :**

 

* If you look at the geographical repartitions, some locations are preferred 
   * No group has gone to Africa (for a concert, Ateez has headline a festival in Morocco)
   * not all had concert in Europe, Oceania or Latin America
* They are some case where groups have performed in countries for festivals but never for concert :
   * UK for Seventeen with the Glastonbury Festival,
   * UAE for most groups, etc.
* Even inside of Asia, some part are never visited : mostly Western Asia (India, Pakistan, etc.)
* The origin of the foreign idol in a group can in some cases influences the stops of a tour, for example :
   * Stray Kids going more often in Australia,
   * GOT7 having a lot of concert in Thailand and China,
   * EXO also doing many concerts in China.
* The Country the most visited by Kpop BG is : 1) Japan, 2) US, 3) South Korea
* The Group with the most diverse stops localisation are Ateez : 29 countries visited, 8 of which they are the only ones to have gone within the group studied
* The Group with the least diverse stops localisation is Treasure : 10 countries, only in Asia and the US
* JYP groups are the one that goes the most in Australia
* 3 groups never held a concert in Europe : Treasure, EXO and Seventeen
* 4 groups never held a concert in Latin America : Enhypen, TXT, The Boyz and Treasure
* While COVID marked a 2 years stop in tours, it didn't have a big impact on attendance numbers. The most affected are 3rd generation groups for which COVID coincided with the beginning of the members military service : MONSTA X, EXO, BTS, etc.
* A high number of stops is not always link with a high level of attendance, groups like Treasure and The Boyz had the same number of stops while Treasure has double the overall attendance.
* Biggest tour (in attendance) :
   * Stray Kids Dominate Tour (2.2M attendance estimated)
   * Seventeen Right Here Tour (1M15),
   * TXT Act Promise (1M1 estimated attendance)
   * BTS Love Yourself Tour (1M04)
* Tour with the most shows :
   * TXT Act Promise tour (55 shows)
   * SKZ Dominate (46 Tours)
   * EXO The Exo'luxion (44 shows)
   * BTS Love Yourself Tour (42 shows)
* Longest tour :
   * Ateez Toward the light (1 year + 2 months)

kpopthoughts,1k9lzxl,2025-04-28 05:22:42,Enhypen & ILLIT's cinematic films are genuinely so impressive,"I love Belift’s Cinematic Films. It’s honestly something I always look forward to every comeback.


The company has its flaws but their creative department is fr stacked with talent. They deserve a raise honestly. They’ve been absolutely killing it every era when it comes to concepts, outfits, MVs, and **most especially their concept cinematic films.**


Belift first started producing cinematic films as part of Enhypen’s comeback promotions a few years ago and it’s become a regular part of their comeback calendar ever since. And the quality keeps leveling up every single time. Seeing the members act out these continuing storylines adds so much depth (and fun!) to the overall comeback experience.


In their last cinematic film, they brought in the Director of Ballerina (Netflix) which led to the members acting out an intense gunfight scene. They also held an actual film premiere event with fans and I thought it was such a creative way to do comebacks. It felt memorable and something the members could be really proud of. The fandom still talks about the cinematic films from years ago.


ILLIT’s “I’ll Like You” mini film deserves a lot of praise too. It had a really touching storyline that gave dreamcore aesthetics with youthful friendship themes. It gave their debut album a chance for interpretation and discussion and really helped with the hype. It was almost 9 minutes long but the pacing was so good that it hooks you all the way through. It even has 3.7M views despite being 9 minutes long! It made their youthful, dreamy image feel a lot richer and more intentional and unique. I think it'd be fun if they kept making short films each comeback.



Cinematic films have become really one of my fave promotions and I'm really impressed with the way Belift does it. It's an artform on it's own and it makes the members really shine in a different way. The people in Belift are really serious about their creative work and their staff deserves their flowers.


And yeah, there’s a small group of fans complaining about not getting the traditional promos like MV teasers or album snippet drops, but personally enjoying this new strategy on focusing on films. It feels rich, new, and the members always seem to have fun trying out new things and getting better at acting each comeback. It breaks the cycle of the usual comeback promos for them.


Now Enha is about to release 3 cinematic films for their comeback (and no MV teasers at all) and honestly, I’m fr excited for it. I hope they slay with ILLIT's next comeback too.",149,21
kpopthoughts,1keshtn,2025-05-04 21:43:13,Kpop fans are all about not pushing idols out of their comfort zones until it's male idols not being comfortable shaking their ass - then it's a problem,"This title sounds so funny lol...

But no seriously am I the only one weirded out by this?

I think it's pretty well established by now with all the dance challenges we've seen with Enhypen that most of the members don't seem very comfortable with dance moves like twerking. They have gotten hate for it before but seem to stick to refusing to do some moves. Lately Jay participated in another challenge, where he once again refused to do the original dance and changed it to doing it a way that was most probably more comfortable for him. 

Next thing you know, people are making shady remarks about how he did not just under that TikTok but under other dance covers of the same dance. 

It's such a non problem where people are pretty much trying to force idols into doing stuff they're not comfortable with. Dance challenges have become a standard way to promote songs, so while some people might say ""If they didn't want to go all the way, then they shouldn't have done the dance challenge at all"" I think it's very likely a lot of these dance challenges are often not the ideas of the idols themselves but their management.

Dance moves like twerking are provocative and often seen as more feminine, some idols, especially males, being uncomfortable doing stuff like it isn't inherently wrong and shouldn't be criticized as much as it is. It's just another case of people once again finding a way to make simple things like idols doing dance challenges into this weird competitive thing. ",376,96
kpopthoughts,1kdwmzb,2025-05-03 18:15:16,What are your favourite boy group live vocals moment SPECIFICALLY with a fast/upbeat/intense song?,"I'm a sucker for some delicious live vocals but i often find the most common suggestions that show off idols' vocals are of them singing ballads or generally slow songs, or the suggestions aren't actually displaying live vocals 😭 (clips/performances with backing tracks BEHIND live vocals bc duh these idols aren't superhuman)

so im looking for recommendations from literally any boy group from any gen of performances/clips where they are singing a song that's fast, upbeat, energetic, could be noisy, just anything that's not slow or medium paced, and where you can hear their impressive vocals. 

of course im expecting performances where you can hear members breathing and taking moments to breathe etc. bc duh

im a fan of the following groups but obviously i haven't seen every performance from all of them but I'd also love to see what other people's fav performances are from these groups and im always down to re-watch some great vocal performances (but aNy boy groups are fine!):

kpopthoughts,1kbo501,2025-04-30 20:47:39,HYBE and their constant sexualization of minors.,"Recently, KATSEYE's Gnarly came out. Now, enough has been said about the song already- I'm not going to talk about it. What bothers me, though, is that they're going hard on the c\*nty concept while they still have Yoonchae, a 17 year old, 2008 liner in the group. The choreography had their back facing towards the camera and twerking, a scene of two flies having sex, a part where Manon smacks Megan's butt (I'd even bring up the fact that Megan is a 2006 liner, but she *is* an adult so we can ignore that, I guess). All of this is not a concept that should be executed by a 17 year old.

This is not the first time a girl group under HYBE has faced such an issue.

First of all, NewJeans with Cookie- a song filled with sexual innuendos. They later released a statement which was essentially gaslighting the audience into believing that they were the ones who were perverted and dirty-minded. At the time of its release, the youngest member was 14 and 4/5 members were minors.

Second of all, LE SSERAFIM have multiple such controversies. Right off the bat, the music video of their debut song FEARLESS had Eunchae (14) and Garam (16) humping on the floor. Choreographies of songs like Antifragile and Perfect Night have gotten flack for similar suggestive moves, but since it was nothing outright, most people dismissed it. When Eunchae was 17, she was made to do the choreography of Smart, which had hip gyrations, twerking, and was pretty well known for being a sexy choreography.

Lastly, probably the issue with the least attention since it wasn't really promoted much- ILLIT with their song Baby It's Both. The song had some wildly inappropriate lyrics- ""Gotta, gotta touch you now"", ""Kinda wanna beg for more; Wanna make up, up, up all night"" and ""Oh, you wanna make me scream"". Iroha was 16, Wonhee was 17.

Do we realize how insane this is? *Every single* girl group which debuted under HYBE has faced issues with sexualization of children.

Heck, even in boy groups- ENHYPEN had Ni-ki performing Fever when he was 15.

I refuse to believe that HYBE doesn't know about these complaints- especially since their internal ""public opinion research"" reports came out. These companies are constantly monitoring and writing whole reports on how their groups are received. They can't not know that people constantly call them out for this, yet they keep doing it. It's very intentional, very disgusting and I can't believe that K-Pop stans have let this slide for so long.

  
Edit: I'm muting this, will come back to it some time later when I have the energy.",1089,428

As enhypen will be in Berlin, (im from EU) I think its a good opportunity to go there, apparently they wont even be that expensive (I heard).

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not. Don't use commas (i.e ""8,8"") to separate your decimals!

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** - they are **optional but *HIGHLY* encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0). You can add them to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Stray Kids - I Like It: 2.1 I do not

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment.** Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* For this rate and most future rates, we have **a ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

kpopthoughts,1k86n8p,2025-04-26 08:39:08,2023 is to k-pop what 2016 is to western pop (from a new k-pop fan's perspective),"Now I know many veteran k-pop fans would be like ""Yeah 2023 was good but k-pop has had much better years"" and that would be totally valid. But as a person who became a k-pop fan in the second half of 2022, 2023 was something else. Looking back at it after two years, it gives me the same nostalgia that 2016 gives me. Now this might be because I was a new k-pop fan but everything felt so rosy and happy at that time. Everyone was friends, there were hardly any scandals, every group was having their viral moments and achieving the peak of their success, streams and sales were streaming and selling like never before. Literally everyone was thriving. Most important of all, music was TOP NOTCH. There were bangers after bangers, I remember people getting tired of listening to good songs coz they felt like they could not miss a release in the fear of missing out on good music. Just to give you an idea, all these bangers were released in 2023:


1. OMG-New Jeans
2. Cupid- Fifty-Fifty
3. Rover-Kai 
4. Flower- Jisoo
5. Sugar Rush Ride & Tinnitus: TXT
6. I AM: IVE
7. Super, God Of Music, Fire, IDUBILU: SVT
8. Bite Me: Enhypen
9. S-Class, La La La: Stray Kids
10. Get Up album- New Jeans
11. Seven, 3D & Standing Next To You: Jungkook
12. Fast Forward: Somi
13. Fact Check & Ay-Yo: NCT 127
14. Crazy Form: Ateez
15. Let Me In, Cream Soda: EXO
16. Fighting: BSS
17. Eve, Psyche and the Bluebeard's Wife & Perfect Night: Le Sserafim
18. Shoong- Taeyang & LISA
19. Perfume: NCT DJJ 
20. Spicy, Drama: Aespa
21. Queencard: G-IDLE
22. Guilty: Taemin
23. Sugarcoat, Shhh: Kiss Of Life

And many more

Moreover, I was also discovering other artists and their past music at that time so it was like an overload of good music for me. Just never ran out of new music to listen to. It was a good time to be a k-pop stan tbh. I was just watching some reaction videos of 2023 songs and it just gave me a sense of nostalgia mixed with a tinge of sadness, which is weird coz all of this was only 2 years ago. It made me want to write this post to look back at that time.",20,41
kpopthoughts,1k7a9ox,2025-04-25 04:34:09,K-Pop Concert Prices in the US are Insane,"I looked into buying tickets for Enhypen and $241 was the cheapest standard ticket upper bowl option. I already purchased tickets for j-hope, the rose, xdinary heroes, and ATEEZ so I was hoping to get something under $100 just to be in the building, but I’m not going to spend that much for nosebleeds. 

I think the bubble on concert ticketing prices for huge shows is about to pop- Beyoncé and Katy Perry aren’t selling out, and SM Town has sold a shockingly low number of seats considering their lineup. Everyone wants to immediately vilify Ticketmaster (and they deserve a ton of criticism for dynamic pricing and exorbitant fees), but artists (or the tour promoters they hired) are setting their ticket prices and allowing dynamic pricing. 

K-pop fans spend a lot of money on our favorite groups. We’re buying multiple physical and digital album versions, fan club memberships, light sticks, weverse content, merch, fan calls, pop-ups, award voting, coffee trucks, online concerts/videos, movie theater events, streaming content, send-offs (which needs to be a separate post on why we tolerate them stacking the fans), and buying and making concert freebies. Do they really have to sell a corner nosebleed at that price?

I understand the prices being a little higher- the shows typically have a high production value, but I’m sad to see them start to price out so many people, myself included because I think we all just want to go and see them. I’ve been to almost 100 concerts, and K-Pop is by far, the most expensive. I’m seeing a pop/rock show next week that cost me $35. 

Have any of you reached your limit? Where does your money go when it comes to your favorite group? ",217,112

kpopthoughts,1k4uj3p,2025-04-22 03:35:53,So happy that Kpop acts are performing in more UK cities now,"Seventeen played Glastonbury and KARD played Birmingham last year and this year, Ateez, Taemin and Enhypen are all performing/have performed in Manchester too. 

It's still a small number of acts, but hopefully it becomes the norm. There is so much more room for Kpop to grow in the UK, it just needs companies to put the effort in. The UK is the third biggest music market globally, so there is plenty of potential. ",63,11
kpopthoughts,1k6oshf,2025-04-24 12:24:13,Discovering LE SSERAFIM’s Discography (Part 1),"[I wrote this while I was half-asleep, pay no mind to possible horrible grammar]


I haven’t done this in over a year with [VIVIZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1ccb1wq/discovering_viviz_discography_pure_elegancy/) so excuse the incoherent writing on this one. That’s mainly why I split into parts, so it won’t be overwhelming for me.


But ever since mid-2024, I’ve been in a stump when it comes to music, and that included K-Pop, checking and listening to new releases felt like a chore, which prompted me to just not check out a lot at all, outside of aespa’s Whiplash album.
 

But over the Easter weekend, I had this sudden interest in listening to LSF’s music, and the reason wasn’t even because of the latest comeback! It just happened.
 

FEARLESS was (and still is) one hell of a debut album, I would go as far as to say it’s a no-skip for me. I know many people don’t care for album intros, I could give or take them myself, but my God, The World is My Oyster really sets the tone for FEARLESS, and listening to the whole thing nonstop is quite the experience.

 
Have you listened to The Great Mermaid with brand new head/earphones? It’s fucking beautiful.
 

FEARLESS (album) is the definition of sweet & sour with groovy, soft tracks like Blue Flame and Sour Grapes, but fierce and bold ones like the intro, title, and Great Mermaid. It’s a statement inside of an album.

 
While ANTIFRAGILE & UNFORGIVEN are not as strong imo, they still hold their own weight and have more variety in terms of sound; Impurities is their first R&B track, and it amazes how well they pull it off. However, they shine the most with more upbeat, poppier tracks like Good Parts, No-Return, and Flash Forward.


Also, before anyone asks, UNFORGIVEN wasn’t that bad lol - the beat was really addicting for me to actually enjoy it! Now yes, do I think it’s the weakest out of their three titles so far? Yes. BUT it’s still an underrated banger for me, don’t get it twisted.


And I know EP&BW is arguably their most well known b-side in their discography alongside Smart for damn good reasons… I’m HIGHLY upset Flash Forward didn’t get some traction. It’s like Blue Flame and Enhypen’s Brought the Heat Back had a love child and created this easy listening, funky, yet party-like banger.
 

With this trilogy, LSF shaped up to be a group to be reckoned with. They had a hiccup along the way with the whole Garamgate, but ever since UNFORGIVEN was released, it was just a minor bump in the road.
 

Then the EASY era happened... 


To Be Continued.

kpopthoughts,1k5apsf,2025-04-22 18:31:13,Why do people act like kpop groups performing at Coachella isn’t a big deal?,"I’ve noticed that people try to act like kpop groups don’t benefit from going to Coachella across other subs and on SNS sites like Twitter and TikTok, and even try to claim that they shouldn’t perform there period. 

I don’t think people see the bigger picture here, not only does performing at Coachella bring more new eyes to the group but there are backdoor business deals when groups and acts perform there. 

Coachella is like a social networking event, artists tend to link up with other artist and/or producers and discuss future business deals i.e Collabs or having a producer produce for their future albums. 

For an example; lsfm performed at Coachella last year and Jungle also performed there as well and now fast forward, Jungle produced a song for them ‘Come Over’ after seeing their performance there. 

Lisa, Jennie and Enhypen (and XG) benefit from performing there regardless of their kpop tags, because they may or may not land some future collabs with other artists or get good producers to produce future songs for them, if no collabs they’ve gained a new set of eyes seeing them perform. 

This whole “Kpop groups shouldn’t perform at Coachella etc etc” doesn’t make sense because kpop groups are still singers and performers at the end of the day and deserve to reach a new audience, especially with the climate that is surrounding the industry’s downward global attention, they should perform there while attention is still hot.

kpopthoughts,1k4rsl6,2025-04-22 01:22:24,Have you ever been annoyed when your fav is dismissed as just a lookalike?,"I don’t know if I’m the only one who gets really annoyed when a member of a group I like is constantly labeled as “X idol look alike” or “the male/female version of X idol.” At first, it might be kind of funny or something I can play along with, but over time, it just becomes genuinely annoying. The idol I like ends up being completely reduced to someone else and only gets appreciated because they “resemble” that person which is honestly sad.

It’s not something that ruins my day, but still kinda annoying 

What makes it worse is knowing that if a video of that idol ever goes viral, the comments will most likely be flooded with people repeating over and over how much they look like X. It’s exhausting, especially when there’s a popularity gap between them. Some people even go as far as to being weird towards the idol as if it’s their fault they look the way they do.

Sohyun from tripleS is my ult bias, and unfortunately, she’s constantly reduced to being “the Sunghoon Enhypen female ver.” I have nothing against him, but it’s been over a year now, and it’s honestly getting tiring. I really hope that one day she’ll be seen and recognized for her own skills, she’s share a lot of good messages, songs recommendations, comfort and she’s also a producer, she really deserves more recognition as her own persona.",41,30
kpopthoughts,1k3l7i3,2025-04-20 14:13:46,"‎""4th gen boy group music is loud"" the biggest scam in kpop history","‎I listened to all the songs of 33 bg groups (I had already listened to many of them, so it didn't take that long), and counted how many loud/noisy songs each had.

Example: JIKJIN, CRAZY FORM, MEGAVERSE, Pass the MIC, I do not consider such songs: Ice on my Teeth by ATEEZ, Wasp by P1Harmony, Given-Taken by ENHYPEN loud. Other - all other types.

Even if we say that the group is called loud/noisy because of the titles, then this is not true, there will also be fewer loud titles (the only exception is maybe SKZ).

I don't understand where all this news, posts ""all BG songs are loud/noisy"" has come from over the last three years if it's a complete lie???

kpopthoughts,1jzyikt,2025-04-15 19:59:03,"Concert DVDs becoming concert ""digital content codes""","I buy concert DVD sets every now and then.

They often come with beautiful inclusions including photobooks, photocards, stickers, little keepsakes, etc.—e.g., Seventeen's[ ""Power of Love"" ](https://shop.weverse.io/en/shop/USD/artists/7/sales/8882)concert DVD set.

I find them to be (for me) a far better value than going to a concert every tour: you can watch the concert as much as you'd like in the comfort of your home, the view is clear, the audience doesn't overwhelm the artists' voices, it comes with many extras (behind-the-scenes, etc.), and the inclusions enhance the overall package.

However, the latest concert sets increasingly don't include DVDs, but rather ""digital codes"" to give the buyer access to streaming the concert videos and extras online.

There was a shift a couple years ago to making two types of sets available: a DVD set and a digital code set, but now it seems companies have made the switch completely: no DVD sets are available for the latest concert releases—only digital codes.

Here's an example of the latest state of things (form factor, inclusions, etc.): Enhypen's ""Walk the Line"" [concert set](https://shop.weverse.io/en/shop/USD/artists/10/sales/37465), available for preorder.

As you can see, there are lots of paper/paperboard inclusions (photocards, posters, a scratch card, a ""film strip"") and a bracelet, but no DVD, merely a card with a digital code to stream the concert and extras.

That wouldn't be terrible if there weren't the possibility of the content being unavailable someday for any number of reasons, including companies breaking ties with streaming service providers, or those streaming services going out of business.

It's likely the case that when redeeming the code, there's some click-through requiring the acceptance of the content not being available someday and freeing the company from any liability should that happen.

It's happened before in the field of online movie streaming services ([Vudu](https://observer.com/2022/09/after-decades-of-failed-video-strategies-walmart-enlists-paramount-to-take-on-amazon-prime/#:~:text=In%202006%2C%20Apple%20began%20offering,service%20with%20another%20tech%20company) is one example). . Sometimes there'll be an arrangement to keep the content one's purchased, sometimes there isn't.

There's now no way so assure you get to keep the core of the concert sets—the concert videos—""forever."" Twenty years from now, if you feel like watching the concert, how likely is it that it's still available to you?

The sets aren't *that* inexpensive, so knowing that the core of the set—the videos—may disappear one day is disappointing. Are there any top K-pop artists whose concert sets are still available as DVDs?

Have you bought these digital-code concert sets before? How do you find them? Is it worth it, even though it's not even cheaper on average than concert DVD sets?",96,54
kpopthoughts,1jrike3,2025-04-04 20:11:06,Sunoo being blatantly fat shamed by ENHYPEN,"The whole allegation of Sunoo being fat shamed by his members came out 2(?) years ago and I fear it’s not being beaten. 

Now let’s be real. ENHYPEN members have made fun of Sunoo’s weight and they still do, provided by the recent En’ o-clock episode. I’ve seen people defending this behaviour saying it’s in Korea culture or it’s just friendly banter, but all of this still doesn’t excuse blatant fat shaming.

Being on the other side, having friends make fun of your weight or how much you can eat, is not a nice feeling. Now I’m sure if Sunoo was uncomfortable he would have told the members, but even if he didn’t, or he doesn’t find it uncomfortable, the members are still old enough to know that making fun of someone’s weight or their ability to eat a lot is not nice. 

This post isn’t to label ENHYPEN members as bullies but to call out their behaviour and also their fans brushing it off as “a joke”. 

Fat shaming is never a joke and it can ruin someone’s life.

kpopthoughts,1jw5imm,2025-04-10 20:48:47,"The Sunoo discourse is tired, outdated, and rooted in stereotypes","I'm going to be downvoted to hell. I'm sincerely tired of the discourse around Sunoo by non-fans. It’s been nearly 5 years, and somehow, Kpop fans have never moved on from I-Land solo narratives. Yes, they had a rough debut and when you add on the really bad shipping wars that happened and **they were just minors being sexualized**—it absolutely affected how they interacted with one another on camera, especially Sunoo and Ni-Ki who've always been attached at the hip.



But it’s been 5 years. Since then, they’ve matured and become second family that aren't shy to be outspoken anymore. What hasn’t changed is the narrative around Sunoo which has been completely false.


**Ya'll just don't know Sunoo.** Or his personality, friendships, preferences or values.


He is made of sunshine and he's not that masculine, sure but he is anything but weak. He frequently calls out antis on Weverse. He fights back. He snaps back. He's been tough since debut. **He's sarcastic and clever. He's one of the smartest members along with Jake.**


He also has really low stamina. The members, especially Ni-Ki, frequently invite him to go out eating/bowling/seeing the beach/ taking a walk but most of the time, he just wants to be a homebody. In fact, Sunoo is known for breaking promises (like promising to never do an aegyo again but still does lol). He always promises Ni-Ki to do X activity, Ni-Ki sulks, and Sunoo promises again he'll go with Ni-Ki next time lmao. Yet, Ni-Ki never tried to change his preferences or push his boundaries. Ni-Ki still chooses to hang out and cling to Sunoo since they met and until now. **He always chooses Sunoo.**


**He dislikes skinship.** Ever since the members grew taller than him, he's never been able to put his arm around them anymore. They frequently hug him and hold him but he rarely initiates himself. He just frequently punches or slaps them and they let him because they think he's cute. But somehow, their lack of skinship is also something to be scrutinized rather than see it as the members respecting his boundaries.


If anything, all the members agree that Sunoo is actually the **most spoiled member** in ENHYPEN. **He’s never paid for a single bill** (as far as we know). Jake said Sunoo doesn't even bother looking at the bill placed on the table when they eat together. They never ever let him carry any heavy items at all. They don't even let him bend to get his own water bottle but will let the other members grab their own. They make reservations and take him out to eat in nice restaurants because he’s a foodie. When the group has to do pushups as punishment, the others will take on more pushups so Sunoo doesn’t have to do much.


ENHYPEN is also a group that usually doesn’t like sharing food but **Sunoo is the exception with them.** Sunoo has shared that Ni-ki and Sunghoon have given him their own dinners just because he said it looked delicious. On days when Sunoo doesn’t feel like eating, Jay has said he orders extra food just in case Sunoo changes his mind. When they go to the convenience store, the members looks for his favorite mintchoco ice cream **even though he never asked for it.** When they go grocery shopping, they make sure to buy extra food, just in case Sunoo decides to eat later.


Do those moments ever go viral? No lol.


Most people don’t even know that Ni-ki and Sunoo used to sleep in the same bed for years because Ni-Ki was used to hugging his sister in his sleep. Ni-ki found it comforting to cuddle with Sunoo and Sunoo got used to it. That never goes viral either. No one also talks about how Jay and Sunoo often have deep heart-to-hearts or when the members buy Sunoo random gifts. Or how they video call each other often when they're apart.


I just feel so sorry for him because it feels like he can never win in the eyes of non-fans. When he doesn’t feel like playing games, the members respect that and don’t push him. When he sucks at sports when everyone else is good, they always hype him up to try. But if they do play rough with him—like they do with each other—they get accused of mishandling him. It’s like people are constantly trying to catch Sunoo being a victim.


Over the years, so much of the discourse around Sunoo has also revolved around his sexuality, simply because he’s more feminine than the rest. And it’s always from people who don’t actually know him. It’s gotten to the point where Sunoo himself has gone on live **several times and said he hates being babied.** That he can stand up for himself. That he even wants to get a buzz cut, eyebrow slit, piercings, and body tattoos so people will see him differently. **He also dislikes aegyo now. He also mentioned that it's unrealistic to smile 24/7**. And just because he doesn't smile in their content, it doesn't mean he's being left out or he's sad. **Sometimes he just doesn't feel like smiling because he's not a caricature.**


I’m just so tired of all these misunderstandings about Sunoo. The only people who think Enha are bullies are people who don’t actually follow them or people who fall for edits made by solos. **Are they perfect? No. Have they made mistakes? Yes. Have they changed over 5 years? Hell yes. They've become so much closer and more intimate as a group and some of their interviews have been surprisingly raw and heartfelt about each other.** I'm just so tired of all these misunderstandings about Sunoo.


People look at Sunoo and project this delusion of a weak, gay victim. When he’s bickering with the group like normal friends do or when he's not being treated like a princess or when he's quietly doing his own thing, suddenly people make up these fantasies that Enha are monsters causing harm to a weak, less masculine guy. It’s insulting to Sunoo. And honestly, **it enforces a really bad stereotype** that gay people can only present a certain way.


I just know Sunoo is sick of this dialogue too. You don’t even have to take it from me. Just listen to him. Read his interviews. Watch how he talks about the members.


>I also often think 'what if it wasn't these members?' I feel luckier every day, to be able to work and grow alongside these guys. It was incredible luck that we ended up with these exact members.


Instead of believing viral edits made for engagement, maybe try listening to Sunoo himself. Because he’s been defending the members this entire time.


Edit: Words.

kpopthoughts,1jr1iod,2025-04-04 04:43:11,Jay from Enhypen’s thoughts about the role of artistry in the K-pop industry should be read by all.,"Recently, Jay from Enhypen [went on Weverse live](https://weverse.io/enhypen/live/0-157695824) to discuss the process of creating his [excellent cover of Bon Jovi](https://youtu.be/8oHZYE_0Ndk?si=D8vig4ua_B4Z1vSN). His thoughts on the role of artistry in the K-pop industry were so interesting that I thought they should be shared with everyone. He hit on a lot of points that have been hot topics in K-pop reddit communities for the past year:

* The importance of numbers & fitting in with trends vs. sincerity/authenticity
* Song lengths / the alleged “fast fashion” approach to music from much of the industry
* The importance of technical vocal skills vs. emotion & soul
* What it takes to be an artist vs. an idol

The following is a rough translation of his thoughts from Enhypen Asia on the X site. Please note that this is just a rough transcript and translation of what he said in the live. I highlighted some parts that stood out to me.



>“**Being in ENHYPEN, there are times when the group’s overall direction takes priority over individual choices, which is natural, because that’s how teamwork works****. But for this project, I wanted to create something I would never regret**. I pushed myself so hard that after all the guitar recording sessions, I didn’t even want to touch my guitar for a while. The solos in this cover are way beyond my usual skill level—I basically forced myself to master them. Even now, I’d struggle to play them as perfectly as I did in the recording. Every night, every after schedule, as soon as I got back to the dorm, I picked up my guitar and played until I fell asleep, and even in my sleep I dream about playing the guitar. In the mornings, I woke up earlier than everyone else just to squeeze in three or four more hours of practice. And since the song is long, if you listen closely, the chorus repeats four times, I could’ve taken shortcuts by piecing together different recordings. But I didn’t want to. I sang it all live, over and over, until I had the best version. The recording sessions were grueling. Singing for hours straight strained my voice to the point where I had to take breaks just to recover. But I didn’t care, I just kept going. I know I probably became a nuisance and annoyed the people around me with my perfectionism, but **I had to see how far I could push myself.** **In a way, this was a test to see my own limits.** Looking back, I do feel a little guilty for making the process so intense, but that’s how much this meant to me.

>Covering a song from a legendary band like \[Bon Jovi\] is a huge risk. As a rock fan myself, I understand how fiercely protective fans can be of their favorite artists. If someone took a song from a band I love and changed it in a way that felt inauthentic, I wouldn’t be okay with that either. So I never approached this cover as a way to prove something about myself. **My goal wasn’t to reinterpret it for the sake of showcasing my abilities, it was simply to express my love for this song,** for rock music, and for Bon Jovi. I wanted to pay tribute to the culture that shaped me. That’s why I focused on the details. **If my goal had been to show off my vocals or technique, it wouldn’t have resonated. I know that there are plenty of singers out there who are technically better than me. But music isn’t just about skill, it’s about emotion****.**

>My only goal was to capture and share the feeling that this song gives me. **I really believe that to be a great artist, you have to be a great fan first**. How can you move others if you’ve never experienced being moved yourself? That’s why I poured everything into this performance. **These days, a lot of music is about the present, and about what’s trending right now****.** But when I listen to rock from the ’80s and ’90s, I notice a different energy. Many of those songs carry hope for the future, like the song ‘Always’, they’re filled with bold declarations of what’s to come. That’s part of what inspired me to take on this project, even in an era dominated by short-form content. I know some people were surprised by my song choice and the idea of a live, seven-and-a-half-minute cover, especially when it goes against current trends. **But I don’t believe music has to follow a formula.** **Just because something is common doesn’t mean it’s right**. For this project, I deliberately chose substance over style, passion over quick hits. I didn’t care about numbers or trends, **what mattered to me was delivering something honest**. And judging by the response, I think that sincerity reached people, and that’s enough for me. At the end of the day, no matter what’s trending, no matter how people define “good” music, the only thing that really matters is how much heart you put into it. That’s what creates something meaningful.

>Music constantly changes with the times, but I hope this cover can serve as a reminder that not everything has to be dictated by the present moment. Sometimes, it’s worth taking a step back to honor the past and look toward the future. And I hope this can encourage you all to do the same, to pursue what you love without being held back by trends or expectations. **If you ever feel like the world is too small for your dreams, then don’t shrink yourself to fit it**. Instead, grow beyond it. So let’s do everything we want to do. Let’s not obsess over the outcome, let’s focus on the love, pride, and sincerity we put into our work. That’s what truly matters.“



What a refreshing take from a K-pop idol! It was so interesting for me to hear this honest perspective on these topics from an active idol in the industry. Also, I can't help but be impressed with how much work and effort he put in for months for this one song. Regardless of what else you may think of them, K-pop idols are truly some of the hardest-working people in show business.",952,86
kpopthoughts,1jt4z6a,2025-04-06 23:27:21,Kpop obsession. Am I the only one or what,"I think my obsession with kpop isn't normal or maybe I'm still new. So first of all I like reality shows and one day I stumbled into ""iland 2"". I really liked the show to an extent where I started voting, dropping everything just to watch it. Mind you I'm not even Korean let alone from Asia. The group formed is izna. To only find out there's season 1 which formed enhypen. I've been really into kpop since last year November. Guys whenever izna or enhypen has to drop something I literally cannot sleep, I'd drop everything for them, if I have to buy albums I would . Sometimes I cry when they achieve something. E.g when I found out enhy was going to Coachella I literally cried so hard(I'm not exaggerating). The times zones are different but you know what I'd stay up even until 3am if need to be. Even when I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is check their accounts. With voting I even use my parents phones and force my friends to vote for them. think I'm got into deep without even realizing it to realize now that I'm in too deep. 

Guys am I the only one?  Like how was it when you first got into kpop? ",2,24

He just released a **7-minute cover song of Bon Jovi's ""Always""**. HE KILLED IT. HE REALLY KILLED IT.


Mother God. It reminded me of the beauty of long songs that go beyond 5 minutes. And Jay's vocals has me levitating and knocked the wind out of me. **Who is he?????**


The guitar, the vocals, the yearning, the bridge, the scream, the emotions, the soul. **THE SOUL.** He did this song justice. Jay killed it and he's not even the main vocal of Enhypen. 


I can't believe the rate at which he's growing and Enhypen as a whole. Every time they come back, it's always on another level that shocks us. It's at their pace, at their time but it *shows.*


I hope more people check out Enhypen and Jay's cover song. He razed all my expectations to the ground and lit a fire in me as a fan.

Soobin struggling to explain why Enhypen is funny but not funny at the same time is literally how every Engene sounds when we try to describe why we stan them (aside from their discography).


In his latest episode, Soobin was really fighting for his life trying to make sense of Heeseung and Enhypen lmao.


>""But I'm a bit worried that, my friend...for about 10 years now, they've been known for being unfunny.""


>""It's really not funny."" 


>""Even after filming this, I've seen Enhypen a few times now. All of the Enhypen guys are quite...it's really not funny. But being with them makes me laugh all the time. They're just so cute. I think they're cute and and funny because of their unexpected quirks.""


>""It was so funny on set.""


>""Heeseung is subtly funny somehow. He's not funny but he's funny.""


Soobin kept saying ""funny but not funny"" like he was really struggling to explain why he found them so amusing 😭


And it's not the first time Enhypen has been described like this. It used to be a drag but it became an inside joke that even the members reference lol. Their dynamic as a group is just different. They're a polite and soft-spoken group so they come across as quiet and calm.


IDOL'S Snack Spree, a show where idols scream and sweep shelves to get snacks also teased Enhypen for this. They made a montage of other idol groups fighting for their lives for groceries and called Enha ""young masters"" for browsing labels before putting them in the cart 😭


I don't know how to explain to a non-Engene that Enha is ""funny but not funny"" but Soobin perfectly represented how Engenes feel when they start stanning Enhypen— confusion, curiosity, laughter, and some cutness? Lol.

kpopthoughts,1jrmqqp,2025-04-04 23:07:36,"JENNIE has joined JISOO, Adele and Taylor Swift as the only female solo artist this decade to have an album sell 1 million units globally in its first week.","I just wanted to make an appreciation post for Jennie because wow, she is EATING both critically and commercially.

For the longest time, she was always seen as the least musically inclined BP member. Every time those BLACKPINK prediction videos came out, there were so many comments speculating that she'd be the first full-time model or the first to dip from the group because of how bored she looked half the time during stages. Her poor choice of starring in the Idol show did not help her image either.

Her latest release is a complete turning point in her career—artistically and overall. You can tell she had a real vision for this album, and it is so cool to see it being brought to life. It feels like she actually took feedback, worked on herself and leveled up big time.

And let’s talk about how she dropped SIX music videos in four months. Each one completely different but still fitting the same vibe. Just when I thought, “okay, she peaked with Zen,” she hits us with *Love Hangover*. And when I thought, “alright cool, solid run,” she throws *External* at us like ???

The title track honestly deserves a whole post on its own. Keeping it short,I’ve always loved diss tracks aimed at haters .And while the lyrics weren’t the strongest on the album , it still works perfectly as the main track. Especially her NPOP stage, she nailed it. The dance, the lyrics, the visuals everything was executed perfectly.

Now that we’ve got Lalisa and Jennie, maybe one day we’ll finally get a self-titled Jisoo and Rose track fingers crossed before we all turn 40.

In my opinion, Jennie’s always had the strongest stage presence in BP—like when she’s on, she’s on. Her main issue was always inconsistency, but the Ruby era? The performances have been so fun to watch—especially Paris and LA. And now Coachella’s around the corner?? I’m literally counting down the days.

Also, the dance challenges? We love to see it. The number of idols doing it is insane—\[Hyun, Wumuti (X:IN), Yujin (IVE), Yeonjun (TXT), Julie (KIOF), IROHA (ILLIT), Leehan, Woonhak (BOYNEXTDOOR), SOOJIN, Mire (TRI.BE), Yeji, Ryujin, Chaeryeong (ITZY), Zena (RESCENE), RUI, HARU (X:IN), Bang Jeemin (IZNA), Doyoung, Junghwan (TREASURE), Hong Eunchae (LE SSERAFIM), Gaeul (IVE), Siyoon (Billlie), Ni-Ki (ENHYPEN), Lee Chaeyeon, Becky G\].

Absolutely loving the positive reception Jennie’s been getting for her album. Even the Grammys gave her a shoutout. She’s also been doing really well in Korea which is great to see.

Every track on the album feels so story coded like there’s something personal behind each one. My personal favorites are Filter,Start a War, Starlight, Zen and Twin(I seriously need to know who that one’s about.)

Whatever she does next—solo, group, or vanishing into fashion week for six months—I’m just hoping she keeps the momentum going. This era proved she’s got more to say musically, and honestly, it’s been fun watching everyone solo drop. Let’s see where she takes it from here",61,18

I'm trying to increase the number of groups in this game ( [kpople.net](http://kpople.net) ) that I'm making, but I want to avoid adding groups that people won't be able to guess.

Also open to any feedback on the game! Thanks!

kpopthoughts,1jffdb6,2025-03-20 04:00:53,Line distribution in K-pop = the bone of contention,"I'm a multistan, and like most people, every time a group releases an album I really like watching the MVs and the stages. But lately there has been a debate (and it seems to be a matter of contention) about the number of lines and centers that each member can have. I've been listening to K-pop since 2014 and I know very well that in groups there will always be two members who sing a lot and it's because they are the main vocalists and there are always one or two who barely manage 10 seconds in a song. 

For example, my favorite group is Infinite. In the songs, they're Kim Sung Kyu ft. Infinite. Sungjong and Sungyeol have 5 to 10 seconds per song, and I thought it was because of the company they were with. Now that they have their own company like Infinite, things haven't changed. So I came to the conclusion that in Infinite, the line distribution is based on the range and vocal abilities of the members. As an inspirit it doesn't bother me because I don't pay much attention to who is singing, I just enjoy the song from beginning to end. 



But it's more common to see a solo in any comeback Comments about ""why does she have more than so-and-so? Why favoritism?"" and things like that. 



Maybe I'm just too spoiled by the injustices I've had in groups before, but unfair distributions seem normal to me because they've always been that way. Thinking about it more closely, it's normal that fans ask for the same possibilities for all members. I understand, but I don't understand the hate they throw at the members who do have those possibilities. 
 Searching for line distribution videos became a ""does she have the number 1 spot again?"" 



This also has a lot to do with the issue of the member who is the center and face of the group. Clearly, they will give that member more opportunities to shine because they attract people or are the favorite of the moment. 



Most groups suffer from it: BTS, Blackpink, Lesserafim, Ive, Itzy, Gidle, Exo, NCT, Enhypen, Stacy, Red velvet, Oneus, etc 




For me it's like one of the many apples of discord in kpop, 
especially in groups like lesserafim who just made a comeback with ""hot"" and many were upset that Kazuha was given a lot of center and lines (being one of the minimum 3 centers in the group). in nmixx people were upset because kyujin has more lines and center (being the center of the group), I live with gaeul's few lines.




 It seems like a constant war to see who is better. and makes the fandom quite toxic about it 




What do you think? Do you think it's totally favoritism or that he has more reasons for doing it this way? 





My opinion: the company will continue doing it that way, highlighting the most striking members to the public. We can ask for better treatment from the other members who don't shine, not throwing hate at the other members. It does give me bad taste when the comments are filled with comments about who sings more or less, leaving aside the song as such but I understand their annoyance.   ",20,52
kpopthoughts,1jelc1w,2025-03-19 02:08:52,Idols who would/wouldn't follow k-pop if they weren't in the industry?,"Which idols do you think would be kpop fans if they weren't idols? Another question kind of related- idols who you think would/wouldn't be as meticulous about their looks if they weren't idols? 

There are discussions about what careers idols would be doing if they weren't idols, but I'm more curious about who would care about kpop if they were just normal people out in the world, not being idols. For example, I feel like TXT Soobin would definitely be a kpop stan if he wasn't an idol (look at his love for Kara, lol) and he'd go to concerts, follow GGs, the whole 9 yards. Same with SVT Wonwoo and of course P1H Keeho. On the other hand, I think that TXT Beomgyu wouldn't care for kpop idols and music if he wasn't an idol himself. He's talked about his music taste before and it's very .... non-kpoppy? I don't think you'd see him at a kpop concert or following any groups because he'd be more interested in rock/indie bands. I think the same about Enhypen's Jay too, if he was just a normal 20-something year old man living in the States, I picture him playing guitar and following local bands but not kpop groups. Meanwhile I think Sunoo, Ni-ki, Heeseung, and Jungwon would be like Soobin, chasing groups around Korea (/Japan) and being a stan. 

About their looks- kpop idols keep super clean because it's their job and they have stylists, right? But who do you think wouldn't be as well-kempt if they weren't idols? I don't mean like, slob levels of unkempt, but more like maybe they'd have a beard, maybe they wouldn't wear makeup, they wouldn't really care about their clothes etc. I feel like BTS Yoongi and RM would be your average adult man who wouldn't get super caught up in their appearance. Jin, Jimin and Jungkook would probably wear makeup on the regular to look nice. 

How do you picture other idols and their relationship with kpop if they weren't idols? Or their relationship with their looks?",37,103
kpopthoughts,1j1idtq,2025-03-02 05:14:42,Can we talk about Enhypen's concert last night?,"I flew in to the Philippines yesterday morning to watch Enhypen live for their 1 day concert here. As you can imagine, I'm exhausted but I wanted to write my thoughts about seeing them for the first time. I'm also a new Engene.


I had certain expectations because it was my first concert with them. In the end, I came out of the concert feeling like a complete moron because watching them from Youtube content did not do justice of how crazy they are.


First, I'm starting to think TikTok clips and Youtube videos are a scam. I knew they were performance monsters but videos that are 10seconds ~ 3minutes long doesn't properly translate what monsters they can be like for 3 hours.


They were dancing was so hard that I was worried their bones would break. It wasn’t just clean execution. They were going all-out as if it was their last day to dance on earth??? Jungwon was popping so hard like he wanted to break his body??? So was Ni-Ki and all the members moved like they were connected with an electric current on stage. It was first time I thought maybe people could actually meet death from dancing. They were absolutely pouring gasoline on the crowd.


Their vocals were just as crazy. Some songs had soft backtracks, some had none at all but the entire concert was undeniably live. Heeseung and Jay were the ones who stood out the most for me. Heeseung is mostly quiet and lowkey in their Youtube content but he's different on stage. He has everything down from performance, crowd interaction, dancing, vocals, banter, stage presence. He can do all of it and the crowd was in love with him last night. He was acting like he was possessed and on fire. His stage presence can't be done justice anywhere else. He is an idol meant to be watched live.


Jay's raw intensity is also 10x more visible in person. He looks angry when he's going all-out so he must've been furious last night lmao. He was extremely captivating and intense. I get now why people went crazy over him during MAMA Toenze. He knows how to heat up a stage during his parts. All the other members commanded attention in their own way. 


I could write paragraphs upon paragraphs about each one. (Btw, did Jake almost cry at his ment?) They all performed like it was their last day alive. At first, people were recording videos but as the concert progressed, everyone was jumping up and down and singing their lungs off. It was a damn festival from start to finish. My weak stamina was finding it difficult to keep up with Enhypen and the Philippine Engenes lol. I thought I was going to need a medic lmao.


Their music was also a huge part of it. Enhypen’s songs are so dynamic and I didn’t realize it was fun to sing along to until I heard it in person. The Philippine crowd is known for doing both the fanchants and full songs so the energy was crazy. The crowd was so loud that my eardrums might've burst. The heat was 31° and I was jetlagged. Enhypen was sweating like an errupted dam but we were feeding off each other's love and energy. The members looked like they were having so much fun. They ran around and had such huge smiles for 3 hours. It's undeniable their chemistry, sense of each other, and teamwork has grown to match each other's freaks. They have this intense aura together and it made them incredibly attractive.


The camera can't capture how captivating they are as a group because I walked in expecting the concert to feel a certain way based on the content I’ve watched online. I walked out with my mind completely blown. They are so different live. There were some awkward moments during their ments since they could be shy and they get easily embarrassed but the second the music started, they transformed into completely different people. 


I haven't felt this way about a concert in a long time. They're working with something to prove. I was wrong when I said they were a lowkey group. Having members with quiet personalities doesn't make them lowkey. They're making noise by being themselves and doing things their own way. Their passion and intensity were so deafening last night. That's not a lowkey group.


Who else caught them last night? They got me locked in as a fan after last night. I was captured lmao. Thoughts?

kpopthoughts,1j5e2g6,2025-03-07 04:21:33,Memes that made you listen to a song or check out a group,"I have been a casual kpop listener since 2011, mostly GGs, but I only started watching content back in late 2023 when I became a Le Sserafim fan. What made me start checking out other groups was memes on tiktok and youtube. I want to see what clips or memes got others into the groups they now follow, or at least made them give the music a chance. If you can, add a link to a clip or at least a search phrase, I want to see if it will work for me too. Even though I have been listening a long time, I don't really know any meme moment from older groups if you also want to include them.

I included some of the memes that got me to check out different groups music. Most of the clips I originally saw on tiktok, but I stopped using it after the US ban (I was kinda addicted)

  
[ITZY discussing visual](https://youtube.com/shorts/JaFFFNGovpY?si=IQp0PmpLb6Q-mU17). All of the members trying to get Yeji to say their name was so funny to me that I thought to give their music a chance and became a fan.

  
[ENHYPEN Sunoo telling Sunghoon he is cuter than Jake](https://youtu.be/9Mno6nYzJoE?si=U4WpS0Ua2qjAUs1m&t=342). I first saw this one on tiktok. It almost made me watch their survival show because I was curious as to how Sunoo decided that this was the best way to make a friend. Instead I just started watching their variety content.

  
[NCT Taeyoung's reaction to Sticker vs everyone else.](https://youtube.com/shorts/lGmG7k-dxOY?si=t1kc2uZ0bCx_ygLK) I've always heard that when members of a group don't like a song, it's a banger. I have to admit that I am with the other members on Sticker.

  
[BTS all lying about how many cards they had.](https://youtu.be/LeKlInK9VLA?si=NlYtFP6l68_1T-vo&t=795) I had zero context when I first came across this clip on tiktok. It was just shot in such a great way to build drama to the final, very funny conclusion. I started listening to their discography because they were so funny. Kind of a longer clip if you wanted to check it out. Unrelated, but ""I Need U"" is currently my favorite kpop song.

  
[TXT Taehyun exposed by Namjoon as a Jungkook fan.](https://youtu.be/v0gDS-kHGkI?si=rYqfEDnwAm9nOdpD&t=6) Honestly, the tiktok comments were the best part of this clip. It led me down a rabbit hole of other TXT content that made me a fan.

  
[(G)I-DLE Soyeon vegetable eating live stream.](https://youtu.be/Rqdvahn9N3Y?si=8C2rE_TcosjJQ3kk) When I first saw this, I thought it was funny how over-dramatic she was about the smell and taste of the vegetables. After I checked out their music, I thought she sounded like the rapper from K-DA. Imagine my surprise after that google search.

  
[New Jeans chicken vs egg debate.](https://youtu.be/j3cJtynhIP4?si=8KMOr5N0bGjP2HTK) I thought it was so funny that they were taking a silly debate so seriously. When I went to check out their music, I was surprised how many songs I knew as a casual.",13,8

kpopthoughts,1iuoy2n,2025-02-21 12:42:06,ENHYPEN 2024 had some of the best hair styling I've seen in k-pop,"To me hairstyles in k-pop are a whole thing lol Is it weird to say? Even the finest person can be destroyed by a hairstyle that doesn't elevate their appearance. So, for a long time now, but especially in 2024, I can't recall a single ""miss"" with Enhypen's hairstyles.

Throughout the year each member had a specific geometry with different variations, so I guess you could call it playing safe, but I believe it was worth it. I mean, if it's not broken don't fix it... I've heard that at some point in the past fans were upset that there was not enough variety in their hairstyles? But I don't think it was true for 2024 for sure. I really cannot come up with a better haircut for each member then what they had last year (still have?). They suit their facial features and overall vibes so perfectly. Ni-ki's ""half up half down"" is iconic at this point, Sunghoon's ""manhwa man"" hair looks like he was born with it, Jake's fluffy middle part,  Sunoo's cute bangs, Heeseung's punk, Jay's classy, Jungwon's elegant etc...

Even some styles that were kinda memed like Jay's long side bangs for that one performance I think looked really cool. Idk I decided to share this opinion because I really can't think of many occasions where not a single member in a relatively big group was done dirty in that regard, for such a long time too.

I don't know if this is going to be a popular sentiment. Like, what is good hair styling to people? It wasn't super flashy, maybe some would find it understated, but what's most important, it really suited each member's individuality. In my opinion it was a perfect balance of being original and varied, but also simple and classic.

Their hair stylists are God sends. I mean, overall enha has a lot of focus on the aesthetic appeal and their team is killing it.",93,19

kpopthoughts,1iwkd50,2025-02-23 21:58:04,Interconnected storylines in music videos are pretty awesome!,"Jungkook's *Euphoria* (considered a BTS song) weaves together scenes from past BTS music videos, continuing their in-universe storyline and portraying each member as a character with unique backgrounds and struggles. LOONA and Dreamcatcher are other groups that come to mind for this kind of storytelling. 

As cool as subtle hints and hidden clues are, a direct storyline with a clear theme and cohesive direction would be really nice.

I not sure if this would work , but I’d love to see a series-style music video concept for a full studio album, where each single continues the storyline. Like, 3–4 MVs in an era, with the first introducing the story and the last acting as the finale. A lot of groups that do storylines (TXT, ENHYPEN, EXO, aespa) tend to stretch them out for years without a definitive end, or they have a more abstract approach that isn’t super clear to the viewer. Apparently, LE SSERAFIM has a storyline too, but as a casual listener, I had no idea. I was thinking more along the lines of a love story—basically, a full concept album where the narrative unfolds with each song.",23,9
kpopthoughts,1in35tn,2025-02-11 17:52:31,It's surreal to watch Enhypen grow in real time,"It’s not about charts or sales. It’s about them as people. 


Being their fan is like watching a slow burn romance. It's slow but they're tenacious.


Some idols start with natural-born confidence. Enhypen's a little different. We saw them at their most insecure because they debuted at an average age of 16 and Ni-Ki was only 14. No amount of media training could prepare a 14yr old for the bloodbath. The kpop scene was so merciless for their early-day mistakes.


We saw them withdraw into themselves and become more careful. Tbh who could handle this much love and hate at 16? They just kept their head down and worked hard.



I watched them start testing the waters. Writing lyrics, suggesting choreography, producing a little. To me, they became brighter and brighter. Their identity as a group and artists slowly came together. Soft-spoken, stubborn, kind, passionate, hardworking. Dancers. Stage producers. Performance beasts. Modern R&B lovers. Always shy but they never stopped trying new things. They really started looking happier and braver.


Then came their first self-produced song. It didn’t stop there once they started creating. They became credited as producers for their tour and they've been so loud and proud about it. Ni-Ki, who couldn't sleep in a bed alone when he was 14, can now confidently act as a stage director to instruct the lighting crew and camera directors for his vision at 18yrs old. Jay wrote Japanese songs despite not being that fluent at first. Sunghoon's become an icon on his own by being the face of the companies marketed towards women. He promotes makeup, lipsticks, and haircare. How cool is their growth? They all used to be so shy.


And the song covers. I was so surprised that Jake, Heeseung, and Jungwon showed potential to be modern pop singers. Their Bazzi, The Weeknd, and Justin Bieber covers suited them so much. Sunoo and Jay’s ballads also shine on their own. These 2 became so confident and cool. Ni-Ki and Sunghoon haven’t done covers yet, but I just know they’ll surprise us too. 


Who knows what's next? Just seeing them test their boundaries is so exciting to watch as a fan. I know this might sound normal to other kpop fans who've seen other idols already make this type of content while Enhypen is still growing. It just feels surreal to watch them evolve as people.


Some idols start strong. Enhypen took years to step into their own. It feels so relatable, like they're normal people trying their best to shine. Watching them surpass themselves and be relentless in their growth has been inspiring.


They’re my favorite stubborn, soft-spoken boy group.",207,17

kpopthoughts,1is3id5,2025-02-18 04:43:33,I think the NBA and K-pop are in a similar position at the moment.,"This is purely anecdotal, but it feels like both the NBA and K-pop currently lack a clear future face. Let me explain.


For the longest time, whenever someone mentioned the word ""NBA,"" if you're a fan, you probably thought of three things:

1) Your team
2) LeBron
3) Curry


LeBron and Curry have been the face of the league for the past decade—longer for LeBron. As we know, they're not getting any younger, and a lot of people have been pushing for or looking for the next face of the league. We've had ANT with the ""Modern Jordan"" narrative, dominant players coming out of college like Zion (RIP tables in NOLA), highlight machines like Ja Morant, international superstars like Giannis, Luka, and Jokic, and guys with a strong social media presence like LaMelo.
Despite all this talent, which is arguably as good as it's ever been, people still associate the NBA with Bron and Steph. There’s this ""fear"" that once they retire, interest in the league will drop because there's no clear successor to represent it.


For K-pop, I think we're in a similar position. For the longest time, groups like SNSD, BigBang, 2NE1, and TVXQ were the face of K-pop for 2nd gen K-pop. Third-gen K-pop marked the genre's expansion era, making it much more accessible to a global audience. Groups like BTS, BLACKPINK, Twice, EXO, and Seventeen were clear standouts of this generation.

This is purely a personal observation from someone who's been into K-pop since 2014, but it feels like the genre currently lacks a definitive face. BTS is still obviously the face of K-pop, just like how Bron and Curry are for the NBA. That’s not to say that everyone else is irrelevant, but BTS (along with Bron and Curry) is simply on another level in terms of global popularity. Ever since BTS enlisted, it feels like the buzz around K-pop has slowed down a bit. You could attribute this to COVID being over and people not being as chronically online as they used to be, but to me, it still feels like there's a gap—like we're missing a group or two to truly represent the genre.

Of course, there are plenty of popular groups right now, Stray Kids, ENHYPEN, TXT, and NCT for the boys; aespa, IVE, NewJeans, LE SSERAFIM, and (G)I-DLE for the girls; but if you asked enough people, I don’t think any of them would be considered the face of K-pop just yet.

Maybe it's because what BTS has achieved is so incredible that it's hard to match; kind of like LeBron and Steph. It’s going to be a long time before anyone breaks the all-time scoring record or the all-time three-point record.

 I didn’t plan on writing this, but I couldn’t get it out of my head, so I figured I’d dump it here and see what you guys think. :)

Edit: just some formatting. It looked okay on desktop but on mobile it was horrendous. ",164,60

**How the songs were selected:**

We used the [/r/kpop Upcoming Monthly Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/archive) to comb through all K-Pop releases from the second half of the year. From there, we examined multiple factors: how many upvotes the MV received on r/kpop, how many Spotify streams a song has, how popular the artist is overall and on Reddit, overall balance, and several other factors. We also used the [r/kpop ""Best of 2024"" TTT results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LF7TGxxKaHBBk324N-nkEXleNVWSLc1MVSUC8JXkzqI/edit?usp=sharing) to gauge what songs Reddit preferred in 2024.

Now, without further ado, let's introduce the 60 songs (and the 7 bonus songs) that were selected for this rate, ordered chronologically by release date:

**The Bonus Rate is optional** and **you do not have to submit a score for every song in the bonus list** if you do it: you can score none of them, all of them, or any number in between. **You cannot give a 0 or 11 to any song in the bonus,** as they are not part of the main rate. While it is optional, we hope you consider participating.

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not.

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** \- they are **optional but** ***HIGHLY*** **encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0).

* **Comments are encouraged and much appreciated** (but not required, except for if you give a 0) and can be added to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Cheeky Icy Thang: 9.6 Okay boomer

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment**. Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* For this rate and most future rates, we have a **ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

kpopthoughts,1imxejn,2025-02-11 13:26:13,"""Has K-pop's popularity declined, or have YouTube's streaming policies changed?""","""I entered the K-pop scene in 2018, a period marked by record-breaking streaming achievements and unprecedented viewership for various groups. However, I have recently observed a significant decline in the 24-hour YouTube view counts for both major and emerging groups. Despite only a few years having passed since those record-setting moments, no group has been able to surpass or even match those numbers.

While it is true that views are not the sole indicator of success—many groups continue to thrive in other aspects such as album sales, concerts, and brand deals—I am particularly interested in understanding the sharp decrease in YouTube viewership trends.""

# 1. BTS

* Butter – 108 million views (May 21, 2021)
* Dynamite – 101.1 million views (August 21, 2020)
* Boy With Luv featuring Halsey – 74.6 million views (April 12, 2019)
* Life Goes On – 71.6 million views (November 20, 2020)
* Permission to Dance – 72.3 million views (July 9, 2021)
* Idol – 45 million views (August 24, 2018)
* Fake Love – 35.9 million views (May 18, 2018)
* seven-Jungkook-35 million views (2023)

None of their recent solo material or songs have reached any of these milestones.

# 2. BLACKPINK

* Pink Venom – 90 million views (August 19, 2022)
* How You Like That – 86.3 million views (June 26, 2020)
* Ice Cream (with Selena Gomez) – 79 million views (August 28, 2020)
* Lalisa – 73.6 million views (September 10, 2021)
* Lovesick Girls – 61.4 million views (October 2, 2020)
* Kill This Love – 56.7 million views (April 4, 2019)
* Shut Down – 51.6 million views (September 16, 2022)
* On The Ground (Rosé) – 41.6 million views (March 12, 2021)
* Flower (Jisoo) – 40 million views (March 31, 2023)
* Ddu-Du Ddu-Du – 36.7 million views (June 15, 2018)
* Rockstar (Lisa) – 32 million views (October 2024)
* Apt – 25 million views (October 18, 2024)
* SOLO (Jennie) – 16 million views (November 12, 2018)
* GONE (Rosé) – 14 million views (March 12, 2021)
* Number One Girl – 12 million views (November 22, 2024)
* Toxic Till The End – 14 million views (December 6, 2024)

Lisa has barely hit 30 million views, while Jennie and Rosé have struggled to reach the 15 million mark with their releases like *Zen*, *Love Hangover*, and others.

# 3. TWICE

* Fancy – 42 million views (April 22, 2019)
* Yes or Yes – 30 million views (October 22, 2018)
* Alcohol-Free – 19 million views (June 9, 2021)
* Dance the Night Away – 19 million views (July 9, 2018)
* More and More – 19 million views (June 1, 2020)
* I Can’t Stop Me – 19 million views (October 26, 2020)
* Talk That Talk – 16 million views (August 26, 2022)
* Scientist – 16 million views (October 31, 2021)
* The Feels – 16 million views (October 1, 2021)
* Feel Special – 13 million views (September 23, 2019)
* Moonlight – 12 million views (February 2023)
* POP – 17 million views (October 2022)
* ABCD – 12 million views (November 2022)

It's surprising how Nayeon’s solo releases have garnered more views than some of TWICE’s group releases like *One Spark*, *I Got U*, and *Set Me*. There's been a noticeable decline since 2021, especially when comparing the overall views of *The Feels* and *Scientist*.The fact that Nayeon solo releases have done so much better than her group songs is something.

# 4. NMIXX

* Part of the Clock – 21 million views (2023)
* Love Me Like This – 19 million views (2023)
* O.O – 19 million views (2022)
* Dice – 21 million views (2022)
* Roller Coaster – 15 million views (2022)
* Young, Dumb, Stupid – 10 million views (2023)

NMIXX was a pleasant surprise with their high and impressive view counts, but they've also started to decline. Their songs *Run for Rose*, *Dash*, and *See That* received consecutively fewer views.

# 5. LE SSERAFIM

* Unforgiven – 18 million views (2023)
* Fearless – 16 million views (2022)
* Antifragile – 16 million views (2022)
* Easy – 14 million views (2023)
* Crazy – 13 million views (2023)

Same pattern

# 6. IVE

* ELEVEN – 9.8 million views (December 1, 2021)
* LOVE DIVE – 11 million views (April 5, 2022)
* After LIKE – 20 million views (August 22, 2022)
* Kitsch – 10 million views (March 29, 2022)
* I AM – 12 million views (April 10, 2023)
* Off the Record – 14 million views (2023)
* Baddie – 8 million views (2023)
* heya -10 million views (2024)

They've maintained relatively stable numbers, without a steep decline. However, songs like *Rebel Heart*, *Attitude*, and *Heya* saw much lower views, especially after they were doing so well initially.

# 7. (G)I-DLE

* Tomboy – 12 million views (March 14, 2022)
* Nxde – 24 million views (2022)
* Queencard – 15 million views (2023)
* Super Lady – 12 million views (2023)
* DUMDi DUMDi – 18.4 million views (2020)
* Klaxon – 6 million views (2023)
* Oh My God – 16 million views (2020)

It's another surprising case. I thought they would be able to maintain their numbers after a streak of 3-4 mega hits.

8. Aespa

* Savage – 30 million views (2021)
* Next Level – 25 million views (2021)
* Girls – 23 million views (2022)
* Black Mamba – 21 million views (2020)
* Drama – 19 million views (2023)
* Spicy – 19 million views (2023)
* Better Things – 16 million views (2024)
* Life is Too Short – 13 million views (2024)
* Supernova – 13 million views (2024)
* DCM – 11 million views (2024)
* Amargeddon – 11 million views (2024)

*Whiplash* received relatively similar numbers, but 2021 truly seemed to be their year.

# 9. ITZY

* Sneakers – 10 million views (July 14, 2022)
* Wannabe – 11 million views (February 9, 2020)
* Loco – 12 million views (September 24, 2021)
* Not Shy – 12 million views (August 17, 2020)
* Mafia in the Morning (MITM) – 13 million views (April 2021)
* Dalla Dalla – 17 million views (February 12, 2019)
* Icy – 18 million views (July 29, 2019)

As my 4th-gen ults, this really hurts. Their recent comebacks—*Imaginary Friend*, *Gold Untouchable*, *Born to Be*, and *Cake*—received such dismal numbers for a group that used to lead the 4th gen.

# 10. BAEMON

* Click Clack – 11 million views (2024)
* Stuck in the Middle – 12 million views (2024)
* Forever – 12 million views (2024)
* Drip – 18 million views (2024)
* Sheesh – 24 million views (2024)
* Batter Up – 22 million views (2023)

So far, I think they are the most consistent on the list, but since they only debuted at the end of 2023, it's still too soon to tell anything. That being said, they’ve already had a lot of MVs, so at least YG is promoting them well!

""While views are not the only indicator of success, many of the groups listed have experienced remarkable achievements, breaking numerous records in areas such as Spotify streams, tours, album sales, and brand partnerships. It's clear that these groups now have significantly larger fanbases than in their earlier years, particularly between 2018 and 2021. However, despite this growth, their view counts have declined. Previously, groups and soloists like Kang Daniel, EXO, Somi, Sunmi, Chungha, TXT, Ateez, Stray Kids, NCT, and ENHYPEN consistently accumulated 15 to 20 million views within the first 24 hours. At that time, top groups were often hitting 50 to 90 million views. In contrast, today, major streaming powerhouses like BTS, BLACKPINK, and BAEMON are averaging 20 to 40 million views, while many other groups are struggling to reach even 5 million views.""

""I apologize if some of the numbers and dates are not entirely accurate; there may be small discrepancies. I have made every effort to ensure the information is as accurate as possible.""

Why do you think we are not able to see such huge numbers anymore ?

TWS - Plot Twist - Jan 22, 2024

Honorable Mention: Enhypen - Polaroid Love - Jan 10, 2022 - not their biggest song but their first viral song.

Why do you think this is, or is it just a coincidence? Is January the best option for newer boy groups looking to break out? Does the new year make the South Korean public feel like trying a group they haven't heard of? What other groups should try this strategy?",10,20

kpopthoughts,1i7towp,2025-01-23 03:58:32,Which songs do you have fully or mostly memorized?,"I don’t mean just the chorus. And did you try or did it happen naturally? 

For me i listened to Anti Romantic so many times that i have mostly memorized the lyrics. (It does help that i know a bit of Korean and it’s a simple song.) Also Enhypen’s Not for Sale, I was obsessed with it at one point and did try to memorize it. It came in handy during the concert :) ",9,36
kpopthoughts,1i27xg7,2025-01-15 22:11:56,"XLOV, Enhypen, and the ""bad"" chorus/pre-chorus","I've been listening to Imma Be on repeat since it came out and I'm fuLLY tuned into everything the new small company group, XLOV, is doing and whatever they have in their future. i think they have a lot going for them for a group from such an unknown company: their whole genderless concept is so slay and different, having only 4 members in a boy group is quite rare and having each member be a different nationality, and their insane choreography that highlights the members' skills (that backbend is insane).

BUT ANYWAY,

I've seen quite a few people have the opinion that they don't like the chorus of Imma Be (their debut song) since it's got a more stripped down, rap sort of sound that some ppl are saying doesn't fit with the rest of the song.

bc of how it sounds, and this opinion, this made me think of the contentious pre-chorus of Enhypen's Bite Me that MANY people think is out of place and ruins the song. so to me, i think these songs are quite similar in terms of critique and/or general negative opinions of that part of the song.

as someone who loves the pre-chorus of Bite Me, i also love the chorus of Imma Be - i personally think the sudden vibe and sound shift makes both songs sooo much more interesting and just like...different😭

of course it's all about personal preference since music is soooo so subjective, but ive never really fully understood the opposition to the chorus of Bite Me, because almost all of the negative opinions I've seen about it are because people think it doesn't fit with the rest of the song.

But as someone who loves experimental music and music where the creators decided to actually try something different and unexpected, i loveee the juxtaposition of vibes/sounds in both songs mentioned.

Does anyone else also like or not hate the chorus of XLOV's Imma Be?

If anyone has a different reason to the one i mentioned for disliking the chorus of Bite Me, could you please tell me why? 
I'm interested to hear the other perspective since it truly shows how subjective music is.

Does anyone else also like when groups try something new and different or something that ""goes against the grain"" in kpop? even if it sometimes doesn't turn out great (to some people)",23,27
kpopthoughts,1hx9ale,2025-01-09 10:41:28,"Enhypen Vocals, casual listener, personal opinion","I do listen to some kpop but do not know their names so sorry in advance.

The deep voice in the Enhypen songs has a wonderful vocal colour. It isn't simply deep either, some melancholic quality to it. Soothing and exciting.

Others sound good as well, expected of professional singers, youthful voices, you can spot the lead vocal oftentimes (wide range, proper breathing technique) and the rest supporting vocals (sweet, boyish, 'boybandy') who get a lot of time to sing but the deep voice is incredibly melodic and the parts given highlight that strength well. Distinct even when singing in a higher range, for example 'fatal trouble' after first chorus, hope it's the same guy lmao

I am a sucker for lovely and longing voices so great job, to the guy. 


Semi related- do they layer vocals often? Do they write/compose the songs themselves?

kpopthoughts,1i32pu3,2025-01-17 00:36:55,Youtube introduces new stats - Monthly Listeners for Artists,"Youtube has introduced new monthly listening stats for artists, which I find very interesting, and also gives a wider glimpse into a international view on Kpop and it's listening base.

Girl Groups (let me know if any are missed, most of these sourced from Youtube but some from secondary sources) - 

* Fifty Fifty -  267M
* Blackpink  - 226M
* Illit -  195M
* NewJeans  - 147M
* Babymonster -  132M
* (G)I-dle - 95M
* Twice -  92M
* Aespa - 88M
* Le Sserafim -  82M
* IVE - 59M
* Kiss of Life -  54M
* Meovv -  40M
* 2ne1 - 25M
* Itzy - 23M
* SNSD - 20M
* Red Velvet - 15M
* NMIXX -  14M
* StayC - 12M
* Momoland -  12M

Boy Groups (some missing) - 

* BTS - 168M
* Stray Kids - 103M
* Bigbang - 65M
* Treasure - 50M
* Enhypen - 44M
* Seventeen - 38M
* BOYNEXTDOOR - 30M
* EXO - 26M
* TXT - 24M
* Ateez - 21M
* Shinee - 16M
* Riize - 16M
* Day6 - 12M

I find this quite interesting, as it shows a different listening base then spotify does for international listeners. 5th Gen has some quite popular songs that do well in places like YT shorts, reflecting their positions on this list. It also shows the geographical differences, for example Russia listens to a fair amount of Kpop via Youtube, as they don't have Spotify, and other examples such as listening base in South East Asia.

It looks like Youtube is now trying to seriously compete with Spotify in how it's calculating and presenting it's music platform.

What are you thoughts?",98,53

I be BOPPING to that shit, then the rest of the song keeps playing and I sit stoically while listening to it. I don't enjoy anything else but the chorus yet I still keep listening to it weekly every now and then lmao.  
  
That's it, that's all I wanted to share lol. Do you guys have a song like that? Feel free to share your thoughts.",13,9

kpopthoughts,1hxf1za,2025-01-09 16:19:06,Whats the point of k-pop group comparsions?,"Lately, I’ve been getting so sick and tired of all the comparisons going on on social media. This group vs. that group’s achievements, wins, dance skills, vocals, concert attendance, etc.

What’s the point?

Success and numbers don’t reflect the quality of the art they’re making. Some may have a more mainstream-friendly approach and therefore chart better, but that doesn’t make the music of the non-charting groups any worse. All of them work hard and create music and content for the people who like it, and those artists are important to them. The groups mean a lot to their fans, helping them through rough times and bringing them happiness. Some fandoms may be bigger than others, but that doesn’t change the fact that the less commercially successful groups with smaller fandoms are still very important and hold a special place in the hearts of those who support them.

Why can’t everyone just enjoy what they enjoy and respect others who enjoy something different?

I just got triggered by a video comparing SKZ vs. ENHYPEN, pointing out follower counts and Billboard charts. And I’m writing this as a STAY. Before that, I was bombarded with videos about people being upset over the newly revived hype surrounding Bigbang and how much more BTS has achieved. Who cares? They’re both great and doing exceptional things.

And who are the people making these videos and posts? What’s their motivation? Are they just looking for drama, clicks, or attention? It seems like a lot of the time, these comparisons and critiques don’t come from a place of genuine interest or support for the artists, but more from a need to create conflict and stir up emotions.

kpopthoughts,1hwjmen,2025-01-08 13:56:56,"Stats about Kpop groups : Age, nationality, etc.","Hi everyone, I'm sorry for the delay between my previous stats post and this one. I was really busy in my personal life and those stats take me a lot of time to compile and analyse.

*Disclaimers :*

*1/ This is something I do to satisfy my curiosity and I don't pretend this is exhaustive nor perfect. I choose the groups based on popularity, on groups known as involved in the production side and in personal interest.*

*2/ In no way is this a attack or criticism against the groups.*

*3/ I choose to start at 2nd Gen groups because I didn't find a lot of reliable data on 1st Gen groups.*

I decided to do those stats because of a few common remarks about kpop that I wanted to verify :

* Idols are debuting younger than ever
* There are more minor idol debuting than before
* They are more foreign idols than before

In those stats I studied 205 kpop groups (106 BG & 99 GG) so 1435 idols (735 men and 700 women) from the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th generations.

My sources are [Kprofile](https://kprofiles.com/), [Kpopping](https://kpopping.com/) and [Kpop wiki](https://kpop.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)

Here are my stats : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kxxf9BtJmXo40ccxQ6C0ZPE-1JIPt4UXemixFe6HjxE/edit?usp=drive\_link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kxxf9BtJmXo40ccxQ6C0ZPE-1JIPt4UXemixFe6HjxE/edit?usp=drive_link)

 And as before here are some quick conclusion for those who don't want to check the google sheet in the link :

*  The average and median age of idol at debut haven't change much but a slight decrease can be observe more visible in GG than in BG
*  Groups also debut with a lesser age difference between the oldest member and the Maknae.The Groups with the biggest age difference is After School which has almost a 13 years difference between oldest and Maknae. The one with the smallest age gap is Secret which has one year between oldest and Maknae (but it's a small group).
* The worst offender in debut groups with more than 50% of member that are minors are : SM (6 groups), JYP (4 groups) and DSP Media (3 groups)
* The companies with the most group that debuted without any minor members : RBW (4 groups), JYP, YG and CUBE (3 groups)
*  Youngest idols to debut : Seowon from Unis (13 years old) and Dongho from U-KISS (14 years old)Oldest idols to debut : Shin Yeoah from Big Mama (29 years old) and Karam from Asc2nt (32 years old)
* **In general girl idols debut younger than boy idols and more GG debut with minor (and with a higher proportion of it) than BG. GG also debut with a bigger age gap than BG.**
*  Youngest leaders in kpop :  Sunye from Wonder Girls (17 years old) and Jungwon from Enhypen (16 years old) and Kim Jonghyeon from NU'EST (16 years old)
* The leader are usually among the oldest of their groups, they are very few case of leaders being among the younger idols in a group : Jungwon from Enhypen and Jinghyeong from DKZ are the leaders and 2nd youngest in their groups. Jihun from KNK being the only leader and Maknae from the beginning (nine from onlyoneof is also a leader maknae but isn't the original leader of the group)
* **Even with an higher proportion of foreign idols, there are almost no foreign group leader.** The only foreign group members are either :
   * Leader of a foreign sub unit : Kris Wu from Exo-M
   * Leaders of group with no Korean members  : Tomoya leader of NEXZ a Japanese group or Fatou of Blackswan group with no Korean idols
   * Leader of groups with a big proportion of foreign idols : Mashiro leader of Madein or Kamden from Amper&one.
* Foreign idols in Kpop are more present with each generation but there is 2 different pattern between BG and GG :
   * BG have a resurgence in full Korean groups but also have a growing present of group with all or a majority of members are foreign : WayV, NCT Wish, &Team, NEXZ, etc.
   * GG have more group with a higher proportion of foreign members and with a diversification in term of nationality.
* The most present nationality in foreign idol or Korean idols with double nationality are Japanese , Chinese and American (mostly double nationality)
* Among all the groups in my stats 137 are considered as active (56 GG and 81 BG).
   * Most had a comeback in the last year
   * 17 groups had a comeback in 2023 (13 BG and 4 GG)
   * 11 groups had their last comeback before 2023 (4 BG and 7 GG)

I hope you all find this as interesting as I do.

And of you have some question, leave a comment and i'll try to respond quickly.

Next stats : stats about concerts and tours (but it will also take a lot of time)

Here is what I'm hopping for:

\- A new Twice member going solo/ a Jihyo comeback?

\- A new phenomenal song from G-idle, because the thrills these provide !!!

\- Soyeon's and Soobin's shows on Pixid being renewed, they're so wholesome!!

\- New great songs from Billie, Yves and Nmixx because their 2024 songs were exactly what I like.

\-Last but not least, a collab dance stage for Illit Iroha and ENHYPEN Ni-ki, the  dance prodigy maknaes!! Very unlikely but not impossible as Illit and ENHYPEN are supposedly ""sibling groups"".

\- I'm also excited to see what aespa, Lesserafim and Illit have in store because they also had a fantastic year.

What is the dance style that you like based on that?,"I don’t know too much about dancing, but my favorite dancers are Ni-ki from Enhypen and Hanbin from Tempest. I’d say they have a smooth and concise style that I like and my eyes are drawn to them a lot in performances. Is there a name to this style and are there other dancers you’d say are similar to them? I’ve heard Hyunjin and Yeojun do, but they don’t draw me in as much. They are very good dancers though.

Also since I’m watching Universe league, I’ve been a fan of Keum Jinho’s dancing. I don’t think his dancing is similar to the two above, but let me know if you see any similarities! (And check out Universe League, it’s been a fun show so far! All the trainees are talented and would make a great group)

kpopthoughts,1hp4gc3,2024-12-29 21:04:19,Reasons why I'll forever be against HYBE acquiring other groups and Kpop companies moving forward...,"As stated in my title, I don't think I'll ever be in favour of HYBE acquiring groups and their companies, and here is why...

Also, I honestly want to know if other people have ever thought and felt this way also? So please feel free to share your thoughts as well, and also brace yourself for a long ""essay.""

The **3 MAIN** reasons are:

1. Most of the groups they had since acquired have now disbanded or are VERY soon going to. Well, all except ONE.
2. They have not proven they can sustain, support and help grow the groups they have acquired outside of the very ONE group that was already vastly more popular than the rest.
3. They have shown little care for the groups they have acquired under the labels they have an overwhelming majority of shares and ownership over. 

# 1) The Acquired Groups' Disbandments: 

I don't think I'll ever stop thinking about how insane it is that all the groups (GFriend, Nu'est, and Fromis\_9) that HYBE has acquired have either disbanded already or are going to disband VERY soon. Well I guess technically speaking, all the groups except for ONE. Though, I don't think it's surprising that the very group out of the acquired bunch who hasn't gotten the boot out of the 'HYBE exit door,' is SEVENTEEN. Who by all accounts (touring, sales, charting, records) are arguably the biggest active kpop boy group at the moment (with BTS on hiatus), and are also HYBE's 2nd most profitable group (only after BTS). I'll be honest, something about these acquired groups disbanding comes off a bit sinister on HYBE's end. And I say this because these were groups HYBE legitimately claimed they would help grow and support. Yet, we have all witnessed and seen that at the first chance of being able to get rid of them, they get disbanded (through their contracts conveniently coming to an end), and with no option of being able to re-sign with the company as a group. Keep in mind, that two of those groups (Gfriend & Nu'est) were more or less blindsided by their disbandment (the members have come out and spoken about it), while the other (Fromis) had been completely neglected & mistreated up until their subsequent end with the company. Furthermore, you can't tell me that it's not strange how all these groups HYBE went and sought after have now all disbanded within the last 2-3 years they were acquired. 

# 2. They haven't proven they can support & maintain them:

Honestly speaking, when you think about it, starting from the year each group was acquired and up until their subsequent disbandment, you'll notice that it is quite a short time frame. And frankly speaking, I don't think that is enough to allow these groups to grow properly despite being integrated under such a big company like HYBE. These groups weren't at the level of SEVENTEEN's popularity when they were acquired, so of course it would be expected that it would take time and much effort to get them to grow...something that HYBE didn't seem to take into consideration or care about doing. If anything, it doesn't seem like HYBE really gave them a chance, instead, it seems like HYBE were indeed expecting instant & bigger results from them once these groups & their labels were officially integrated under them. But atlas, once that didn't happen they were quick to throw in the towel and just wait until their contracts ran out to toss them out. For instance, just look at the time frame from when each group were acquired to then their subsequent disbandment, and you'll notice that they were all done roughly within a 2-3 year time frame. 

* **GFriend (Source Music)** \- Acquired July 2019 / Disbanded May 2021
* **Nu'est (PLEDIS)** \- Acquired October 2020 / Disbanded March 2022
* **Fromis (PLEDIS)** \- Acquired August 2021 / Disbanded? December 2024

As you've seen, that's quite a short time frame, and definitely a cause for concern that other companies with existing groups would look at if HYBE potentially came knocking on their door trying to acquire them, and I am guessing this was probably the case with SM Ent. I'll be honest, as much as I hate SM Ent, I genuinely do understand the fear and frustration they had when HYBE came trying to acquire them (via Lee Soo Man). Because even though SM Ent have their own issues (often illegals ones at that), and are far from perfect. However it's been made pretty clear for the last few years, that out of the BIG4 companies HYBE is THE MOST money hungry and greedy for success, especially instant success. Furthermore, HYBE have shown that unless a group is giving them astronomical results, they will have no problem neglecting them and subsequently choosing to abandon them, and this has become quite evident when looking at the groups (Gfriend, Nu'est, & Fromis) who no longer are under HYBE. Unless those groups were out here selling 500K or 1M with each album release, or racking in a substantial amount of money through touring & concerts, then honestly it was pretty clear they were going to get left behind. But again, this is one of the main reasons SM was heavily against HYBE taking over. Because unlike most HYBE groups who do pretty much bring in astronomical numbers (especially with their album sales), this can't really be said about most SM groups CURRENTLY, especially their older groups. And yet despite how trash of a company SM is, and how badly they have neglected their older groups who no longer carry the same fame they once had, they still end up having the highest outcome of maintaining legacy acts. In other words, they are still somehow capable of keeping their older groups despite their older groups not pulling in insane numbers and aren't as popular as they used to be. Something HYBE will struggle with if they keep disposing of their older groups, much less the ones they've acquired. Which frankly speaking, they technically already have. 



You see, I was watching SM's Game Caterers the other day, and I was genuinely impressed to see how much SM was still able to keep their older acts, starting all the way from 1st Gen (Kangta x H.O.T) to 5th Gen (Wonbin x RIIZE). While watching SM's Game Caterers I couldn't help but compare how when it came to HYBE's Game Caterers the groups that were present were mostly 4th Gen groups (Fromis, TXT, Enhypen, Le Sserafim), and with only two 3rd Gen groups present (SEVENTEEN & Nu'est). But now one of those two 3rd Gen groups has now since been disbanded with one of their 4th Gen groups also soon heading towards disbanding (or at the very least their contract ends with Plybe very soon). Now since then, when you really think about it, there really isn't any other group in that company that is as old or older than BTS & SEVENTEEN, especially now that Nu'est & Gfriend are gone (yes I know the girls are having a reunion, but they aren't officially back together). Plus, we know BTS is an exception...they aren't the rule they are the exception, both with regard to Kpop and with HYBE, and so we know by this point that they won't get disbanded unless the members themselves choose to. But now I can't help but think, what about SVT? They aren't in the same frame as BTS. Yes SEVENTEEN is big, but BTS is BIGGER. And now seeing how HYBE has treated the acquired groups thus far, I am sure lots of us (especially Carats) can't help but think it's very likely that had SVT not been as big as they were before the acquisition, then Pledis would have never been sought after by HYBE in the first place. Furthermore, IF Pledis had still been acquired, it's clear that had SVT not been as big as they are right now and pulling in these astronomical numbers that they do for HYBE, then they would have gotten the boot out once their first contract had ended. It now begs the question, what was the point? What was the point of acquiring these labels and their groups if they weren't going to help support and sustain them? 

# 3. They don't care, They never DID!

Since the disbandment of GFriend, Nu'est and now soon Fromis, it's been made pretty clear that HYBE isn't really here to help grow and sustain groups (much less the ones they acquired), but rather here to grow and sustain themselves. It's clear that unless these groups under HYBE are bringing in huge numbers to the company, then the company could care less about keeping them, and it sure as hell is proven that it doesn't matter if these groups are popular domestically, cause at the end of the day that popularity needs to reflect well with the numbers. HYBE is a company that very much looks at dollar signs and numbers, and so even if a group is mildly popular (mid-tier) if that popularity doesn't actually reflect with the numbers or even show a higher potential for greater and more popularity, HYBE is leaving these groups in the dust. HYBE is a company that is currently still going through their expansion phase (which is another issue I have with HYBE), and so they are heavily reliant on instant success for their groups (and other ventures) to help speed run their expansion so they can quickly establish and cement themselves as one of the big dogs, and not just in Kpop but worldwide. This is why they are running around like Thanos picking up labels and/or establishing ones in different parts of the world (US, Japan, Latin America, etc.), but also pumping out new groups (different labels or not), with 7 groups debuting in the last 2 and a half years, and supposedly 4 more groups on the way starting next year. With this in mind, it's been made pretty clear that acquiring these groups were just part of their ongoing quest to reach their actual goal, and so they never really cared to put in effort in helping support, grow and maintain these acquired groups. These groups were infinity stones that were needed for a larger goal, and once used or shown to have no more value, they were gonna be discarded. 


I mean, think about it...if HYBE truly cared, they would have definitely done more for them. Just take Fromis for instance...yes Pledis is also to blame, but I feel as though people either fail to consider, or willingly choose to ignore that 1) HYBE is the parent company, 2) As the parent company they also own an overwhelming majority of the shares under these acquired labels (most especially Pledis with 90%), and 3) It has been already made clear that most of the original management and staffs who had worked under Pledis don't anymore, and have been replaced with people from HYBE or BigHit. This was especially the case with the original Pledis CEO (Han Sungsoo), in which it wasn't up until recently (literally just last month actually) that HYBE decided to bring back the original Pledis VP (Kim Yeonsoo) to become the new Pledis CEO. But make no mistake that before Kim Yeonsoo, the new Pledis CEO who had replaced the original Pledis CEO (Han Sungsoo), was a former BigHit VP (Lee Dahye). So yes, I very much blame Pledis for the mishap and mistreatment that goes on in their label, but HYBE to me holds the majority responsibility and blame. Because at the end of the day, if HYBE truly cared they could have intervened (like they typically do) and gotten the situation with Fromis settled before one of the members had to publicly speak out about their unfair treatment and not getting paid compared to their other HYBE label mates.  

# CONCLUSION:

All in all, I will forever find it strange that HYBE went and acquired these groups & their companies (even took a loan from the bank to acquire one of them), and claimed they would help support them. But yet most of these groups have since been disbanded within the last 3 years since they were acquired. And yes their labels hold some blame too, but I am definitely pinning most of blame of these groups' disbanding and their neglect on HYBE. Because since observing HYBE and their treatment of their acquired groups, it's been made pretty clear to me that instead of helping them grow, and providing them with proper support to sustain and maintain these groups, they instead chose to neglect them and then throw them out at the first chance they saw that their contracts were coming to an end. SEVENTEEN being the only group out of the ones that were acquired to ever get the option and chance to renew as a group under HYBE and their respective label (who are under HYBE), will always have me looking at HYBE sideways. These groups were done dirty forreal.

kpopthoughts,1hgft1n,2024-12-17 18:27:19,I have once again fallen in love with Enhypen Heeseung's singing + An appreciation for IU's Love Wins All,"A few days ago, I came across a clip of *Love Wins All* on Twitter, and after hearing it again for the first time in a while, I instantly fell in love with it. It wasn't particularly memorable when it was first released, but something about it clicked for me this time. I then went to YouTube and found a [live performance of the song from her concert](https://youtu.be/ax1csKKQnns?si=15LECpuK73lj8Mlj), which I highly recommend. I've already watched the video at least five or six times, along with another live performance from a different concert.

By chance, I also stumbled upon a [clip of Heeseung singing Love Wins All ](https://youtu.be/vrBC0Pd-Zz4?si=LbF7oDk0R4Fr4T_h)during an Enhypen concert. His voice sounded incredible—no background music, just him singing. I highly recommend checking it out too. The reason I say ""once again fallen in love""  is because the first time I fell in love with his voice was when I heard [his cover of *Off My Face*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=HXWVKFa4dL6dsgyu&v=n4PDo8W2FJQ&feature=youtu.be). This led me down a rabbit hole of watching more of his covers, including *Anti-Romantic*, *Golden Hour*, *This Is What Falling in Love Feels Like*, and more. For the past couple of days, I’ve been immersed in his performances, and I can’t get enough.

So, yeah, Love IU, love Love Wins All and love Heeseung.",56,10

kpopthoughts,1hi20iz,2024-12-19 21:17:52,Sometimes I wonder what those idols with super viral cringe moments think about those,Like that one guy from ENHYPEN where he acts like a dog in one ending fairy. Its always included in top kpop aura losses or worst ending fairies ever even though it happened a while ago and he looks super young in it. or that one fancam of a GFRIEND member acting like a baby. Do they regret or feel cringe when they see that stuff??? personally it would mess me up really bad especially if it kept being brought up after years. ,28,20
kpopthoughts,1hdhypx,2024-12-13 18:53:47,Why Enhypen Is THAT Group and Always Will Be.,"Not to be biased or anything (okay, maybe just a *little* as a Day 1 ENGENE), but let’s be real—Enhypen has one of the strongest discographies in the industry. Like, how do they barely have any skips? Every album just hits different. Their choreo? Always on point—clean, sharp, and innovative. the songs are always so unique and it just grows on you how many times you listen to them.  Musically, they don’t stick to one sound either but still stick to their vampire concept which i JUST LOVEEE.

And let’s talk about that vampire concept for a second, the thing that got me into their group. From their debut, they’ve stayed so consistent with it while keeping it fresh and exciting. It’s so unique—mysterious, cinematic, and honestly iconic. You can’t help but be drawn in. Even my non-ENGENE friends who 'don’t stan' are like, 'Okay, this group is kinda insane,' and I’m just like, *Exactly.* I still remember their MAMA debut stage like it was yesterday. i remember thinking, Okay, this group looks interesting Fast forward, and now I’m fully whipped for them. And don’t even get me started on their visuals—like, duh, they’re all insanely gorgeous we ALL have to agree and i don't know how to say that but they just FIT each other in that strange yet perfect way .Their aura screams sophistication and elegance while still giving that youthful, relatable vibe  and sraight-up *expensive* energy.

Yeah, I know the fandom has its toxic moments, but the group itself? Easily one of the most hardworking and dedicated out there. Special shoutout to Jungwon, though. he’s not just a leader; he’s *the* leader. That guy is hands down one of the best leaders in 4th gen. He’s never slacking, always active on Weverse—posting, replying, doing lives—you name it, he’s doing it. every single day. He genuinely cares about keeping fans updated, which takes so much love and dedication, especially when Enhypen is literally one of the busiest and most overworked groups right now. Respect.

Honestly, the way he was betrayed by some fans over baseless rumors? Absolutely heartbreaking. The guy has given his all to the fandom and the group, and this is what he gets? It’s so upsetting because Enhypen is one of the most dedicated and talented groups out there, and they deserve nothing but love and support. ",3,17
kpopthoughts,1hcjqu9,2024-12-12 13:11:19,"Jungwon, the man he is 🤌. I freaking love Enhypen ","I am amazed by how Jungwon stood up for himself. Never did i see an idol address the dating rumours themselves. He was so freaking cool, he came live and saw the comments about him dating and said “im not dating nor do i smoke, and I don’t how they post without thinking about the consequences” damn, i am totally impressed. 

And somehow Enhypen has always been this way, this is not the first time when one of the enhypen member stood for themselves and addressed the issue headon and i love them for that.


And also fck Belift, they should be doing this, they should be protecting their artists!


P.S to all the people supporting belift - all they did was deny the dating rumors but failed to address the other allegations, the sasaeng clips, multiple spam accs posting speculation, as well as the false articles released towards the mainstream. ",366,93

kpopthoughts,1hbihaz,2024-12-11 02:50:48,"""Dark Blood"" was ENHYPEN's most cohesive , and best body of work yet . ","I really hope this is not an unpopular opinion , but lately I've been thinking about it . Here's the reasons as to why I think ""Dark Blood"" is the best body of work ENHYPEN has released : 
1. It's their most cohesive body of work . 
The tracklist , from start to finish , just makes ..... sense . Every song feels like it's where it's supposed to be . This also ties into my next opinion , which is ....
2. ""Dark Blood"" has no skips .
You've ever listened to an artist's body of work , and though overall it is good , there is just those one or more songs that you skip ?? That isn't the case for ""Dark Blood"" . All of the songs are bangers . I can listen to all the songs on ""Dark Blood"" , and I won't get bored .
3. The comeback was clearly the one that had the most effort put into it.
From the piece of cinema that was the trailer , to the outfits , and the music itself .... Someone was clearly about to be evicted from their goddamn house if they didn't make a fire mini-album . Let's not talk about how the music video for ""Bite Me"" was just a little low-effort . At least it's nowhere near as bad as ""Sweet Venom"" . That music video was literally the bare minimum . Hated it . The boys carried . 
4. ""Dark Blood"" is the comeback that I genuinely think solidified ENHYPEN as one of the biggest boy groups in K-pop .
I won't bother to elaborate , because I'm planning on doing that in another post . And also , I think I probably had some other things to say , but I'm tired , and I literally forgot about what I was thinking , so this is all I got for y'all .

kpopthoughts,1hhhp1l,2024-12-19 02:41:50,Song Reviews:: 2024 December 16 - December 18; Greatest Hits: Girls' Generation; 2024 Holiday Song Compilation,"Halfway through the month. Halfway through the week. Almost through with 2024. We will survive this, if not thrive.

It's Wednesday, so here is the [music show wins](https://justalittlefangirllove.blogspot.com/2024/12/music-show-wins-week-of-1211-1217.html) summary I do. We're getting sparse on the music shows because of the award shows, but ASC is still here and Cravity was on this week. They're adorable, and I think one of them wants to trade places with Taeyoung as MC. 

I've started on the wrap-ups for both December and 2024. One is going to be a lot longer than the other, which makes sense because one is a lot longer than the other.  And since it's the middle of the month, here are the [December reviews](https://justalittlefangirllove.blogspot.com/p/december-2024-reviews.html) so far. Feel free to peruse.

Speaking of wrap-ups, like with Halloween, I decided to do a seasonal post. It's structured differently than the Halloween one, with ten older songs and then the releases so far. It'll be updated as the holiday/winter songs are released so check back periodically if you care to. I hope you find one or two you like to add to your own playlists. There's also very little commentary from me as it is more of a compilation post than a commentary post. It's already located in The Junk Drawer should you wish to find it again. Without further ado, here is the [Christmas Caroling: 2024 Edition](https://justalittlefangirllove.blogspot.com/2024/12/christmas-caroling-2024-edition.html) post. 

I love the not-B.A.P B.A.P Christmas album so much. All three songs are great, but the title track was very well chosen as the title track. And I really liked the music video for The Last Christmas, which is a company-wide song like what used to be done often, but are rare now. This one is for BPM, so that includes Taemin, VIVIZ, EXO-CBX, and not Ren because he's in the military. I expected it, but it doesn't make me sulk any less which is why the review is so late. If they do one again next year, he'll be missing from that one too. It's fine.

I picked the Greatest Hits this time based on a complete whim and impulse. The music video popped up, and I just decided to do it. My impulse control is low these days.

I'd just like to thank everyone who has read thus far. Even if you don't read any of the reviews, I hope you have a great second half of the month, and that things aren't too stressful for you. 

Also, thank you if you read the reviews. Let me know if there's a song you'd like me to cover [via the submission form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdulAirRrAgkXERuU7bo1cpIwtlZusq4WG_84mPbozxOjBBlg/viewform?usp=header) You're wonderful. You're lovely. You're fantastic.  Thank you very much.

GREATEST HITS [Girls' Generation ""FOREVER1""](https://justalittlefangirllove.blogspot.com/2024/12/greatest-hits-girls-generation-forever-1.html)

There have been so many covers put out in the last little bit. Buckle up. Nomad, my favorite rookie indie group, did a [cover of Justin Bieber's *Mistletoe*](https://youtu.be/By7IKGRTX70?si=dKNVE8zEeVDZrsAn)*.* Catch the Young, one of my favorite rookie bands, posted this short [cover of aespa's *Whiplash*](https://youtu.be/jDoZNy8GdGI?si=5IjY3MoYceWlU01Z), AS WELL AS a full [cover of Ariana Grande's *Santa Tell Me*](https://youtu.be/jDoZNy8GdGI?si=zBGvu06JULyH7pxk).  Enhypen's Sunwoo did a [cover of Crush's *Beautiful*](https://youtu.be/k2eZVnMOvrg?si=P5DGn14ZaRiFa5V9). Sanha from ASTRO did a [cover of ...a song](https://youtu.be/a3dkA95FkgY?si=3tW7rvKVYH6rIWR5). I have no idea what the name of the song is, or who the original artist is. That title is in Japanese. All I know is Sungjae from BTOB covered it closer to the start of the year, and it's gorgeous, and Sanha did a great job. And xikers, one of my monster rookie groups although I'm going to have to stop calling them that when they hit their two year anniversary, also did a [cover of EXO's *First Snow*](https://youtu.be/f0pSQ5G7c_A?si=KkkeLMZxGDfB0UMM), like Younite did last week. I know I missed some. If you know of any, please leave a comment so I can check it out. I love covers. It's my favorite part of survival shows.

There was one debut that I can tell. Wish, formerly of ViV, debuted as a soloist with [what's your wish](https://youtu.be/ejpX3fTXQDQ?si=Y6arUtac2EQOCaS0)*.*

This was a long post, and if you made it to see this, you're amazing, and thank you. As a thank you, I'm pretty sure that Seo Taiji is releasing a new song tomorrow my time, today Korea time, in about ten hours, and I wouldn't have known if I hadn't added a bunch of searches related to him into my YouTube algorithm for that Greatest Hits I did. I don't know if anyone other than me cares, but I really care and I am deeply curious about this. 

Fun Fact: there's a town in Spain that apparently recognizes dogs and cats as citizens. I have a lot of questions about that, but I also think that's cool.",5,4

kpopthoughts,1h88obd,2024-12-06 19:52:19,Chinese system of (already 6) generations in kpop,"So I was lurking on Chinese internet and found out that Chinese kpop fans have a different generations system. By their system, next year will already be the last year of sixth gen in kpop. So their system goes like this:

∞ - 2005 (first gen)  
SES, SUGAR

2006-2009 (second gen)  
Kara, 2NE1, 4minute, f(x), SNSD

2010-2013 (third gen)  
SISTAR, Miss A, EXID, Brave girls

2014-2017 (fourth gen)  
Mamamoo, Red velvet, Twice, Blackpink, Dreamcatcher, Weki meki

2018-2021 (fifth gen)  
Gidle, iz\*one, itzy, aespa, stayc, ive

2022-2025 (sixth gen)  
Kep1er, nmixx, lesserafim, nеwjeans (though some posts include these groups into 5th gen); kiof, illit, babymonster

It is very interesting that a lot of Chinese fans are actually surprised by Korean system, saying things like ""How can Twice be a 3rd gen group?"" and thinking that Korean system is inconvenient. I also thought that it is funny how while in 2023 other kpop fans were arguing whether we're alreasy in the 5th gen or not, Chinese fans thought that the 5th gen was already over.  
What do you think of this system?

Edit: I decided to make a list of bgs too, since the topic seems to be interesting 

∞ - 2005 (first gen)  
TVXQ, Super Junior

2006-2009 (second gen)  
Bigbang, shinee, 2PM, B2ST

2010-2013 (third gen)  
Block B, nu'est, btob, exo, bts

2014-2017 (fourth gen)  
got7, monsta x, seventeen, ikon, astro, nct, pentagon, wanna one

2018-2021 (fifth gen)

kpopthoughts,1h74vgu,2024-12-05 09:50:15,To my fellow multi-stans : how do you interact with each group content/music ? ,"Following my Spotify wrapped, I started to think about how I interact with groups. Enhypen is my number 2 artist and I would have never guessed it because I don’t consider myself as a fan. Obviously I adore their music otherwise they wouldn’t have pushed Ateez to number 3 😂. 


I personally see it as follow : consuming music related content (streaming and MVs ) VS caring for the members (through variety shows, social media, interviews, bts). Lines can obviously be blurred between a stan and a casual listener, as proven with my own experience example. Now I’m curious about how it is for others 😊. 


My own examples : 

Stray Kids / Ateez = consume their music and group content
Enhypen = music/Mvs only 
BTS = mostly group content and solo music ( I love every member solo releases )

For albums, the tracking period was from Oct. 28, 2023 through Oct. 19, 2024.

If one takes those into consideration, here are the debuts from those weeks (considering that kpop albums are generally front loaded so they should give you an idea of well they fared).

kpopthoughts,1h30h0s,2024-11-30 01:45:51,Interactions is what I miss the most these days,"Back then when variety shows are the thing in Korea, we get to see celebrities from all backgrounds, actors, idols, artists, deejays, comedians etc, on a show and there will be funny and interesting interactions. Now that variety shows are not as prevalent as back then and 4-5th gen idols not going to these shows (either because they are not invited or they just do not go for whatever reasons), I did not get to see as many interactions.

I remember how Junho become friends with Song Joong Ki because they appeared on Lets Go Dream Team. I remember how 2PM become friends with SNSD from multiple shows, performances and CFs. When it comes to my fav these days, SKZ specifically, we get SOME interactions on Kingdom (sadly COVID restricts everything and interactions) and maybe a few dance challenges. SKZ do not do much dance challenges in the first place, do not appear on many varieties and does not appear to have much interactions with any other celebs outside SKZ themselves. They do not even interact much with fellow JYPE artists though we do know Changbin’s best friend is in Ateez and IN’s friends included Enhypen member, Changbin is even close to Chaeryeong of Itzy.

I know, idols have friendships behind the scenes. Like we have seen Bang Chan and Cha Eunwoo are actually friends (surprisingly). But I love to see on screen interactions coz it can be so much fun. Maybe I am making a mountin out of a molehill but I just want to get this off my chest coz I suddenly saw a video of Junho and Song Joong Ki.",11,15

She is with hybe (previously Bighit Entertainment) from 2010. She was there when BtS was forming and supported them, recently she was seen (here)[https://youtu.be/71y2xhHOj98?si=2fyo1k7MBHkFi4Wg], at the very first. She was one of only ten employees when BTS began. (Also helped so that jimin could be in the group 💝)

She was head of HYBE's Training & Development (T&D) Division before this. She helped to form BTS, TXT, Enhypen, Lesserafim.

She has been named among 2023 Billboard Women In Music and was recognised in Billboard's 40 under 40.

She is an OG Bighit staff and not some game bros so o hope she will pay more attention towards their artists. ",954,206

kpopthoughts,1gz1iyt,2024-11-24 22:05:44,Which concerts did you go to this year? Who did you end up missing out on? Who was your favorite?! ,"Title. It seems like a good bunch of groups toured this year so who did you end up seeing? How was it?

I got back into kpop in May so I was lucky to see Itzy, IDOL, and Lossemble. As far as a whole experience, I'd say my favorite was IDOL because I got side view sitting seats whereas I had to stand all night for Itzy with ground view. Loossemble was amazing too, I was impressed by their live vocals and dancing + realized they're the first group I discovered with a no-skip discography for me!

Now for the concerts I ""missed out"" on are:

* IVE - I wasn't following kpop at this time :(
* Chuu - I discovered Strawberry Rush but I wasn't familiar with her at this time + didn't know about the tour
* VIVIZ - I only really liked 'Maniac' and 'Untie' at the time...
* ARTMS - Just discovered them + it was too close to (G)I-Dle's date
* Everglow - Got canceled + tickets were expensive for me considering I only started following since 'Zombie' era
* Weeekly - Wasn't too familiar with them at the time but from what I saw on youtube, I really liked their charm on stage and songs!
* Dreamcatcher - just couldn't afford to
* Fifty Fifty - I'd love to see them but I have to work since it's the holidays
* Kiss of Life - I'm in the money saving mode because I've been buying albums but when Igloo dropped, I had instant regret. I'm currently hooked on this song/dance. Did you know the audio video for Igloo has 14M views?! Also, this has been the most in-demand concert I've seen this year but then again they booked a lot of smaller venues so I get it. I also think they're the perfect group for the western audience because no language barrier and their concept is close to what we're used to. Lastly, their live vocals and energy is just top tier, so much charisma from what I've seen from fan videos.

I just got tickets to aespa but I really hope to see NMIXX, STAYC, Le Sserafim, Twice and Red Velvet in the future

Question - I mainly just follow girl groups but for those who saw Enhypen and TXT, who would you say was more in demand? Whos' tickets sold faster / more? I'm curious because I realized I actually like these two groups and I might want to see them in the future, thanks!

Edit: I'm a little shocked that no one has seen both Enhypen and TXT yet D:",31,134
kpopthoughts,1gzfc5v,2024-11-25 10:50:52,Went Full Boomer and Downloaded 4 Years of Korean Charts - My Ears are Bleeding (in a Good Way?),"Alright, you little rascals.  7 years into this K-pop rabbit hole and I finally did something truly unhinged.

I had this dumbass realization that ""K-pop"" stands for ""Korean Pop"" and somehow expected the K-pop genre to encompass the \*entirety\* of Korea's pop music scene.  Yeah, I know, I'm an idiot.

So, naturally, I fired up my media server and downloaded the Top 100 Hits of South Korea from 2020-2023.  That's 400 goddamn songs, folks.  400!

Feast your eyes on the sublimely mundane album art I whipped up for this monstrosity:

[It's so bad it's good, right?  Right?!](https://preview.redd.it/uxnxhep8d03e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ceaf7307b2e032fb19c3e6abc7dab8e68cdfcf81)

Anyway, I dove in, ready to expand my horizons.  Turns out, I only knew about 1/3 of the artists.  After 7 years!  Who the hell are all these people?!

So, I did what any sane person would do: listened to every. single. song.  I'm a girl group stan at heart, and my taste is totally normal so expect my opinions to be just like your aunt Edna or cousin Vinny.

What shocked me the most was how much of Korean pop sounds straight-up Western.  Like, could easily slot into the Billboard 100 if it were in English and the producers were on some Diddy list.

Then you get the flip side, with stuff that sounds so distinctly Asian it’s like landing on another planet.  It’s wild.

I stopped downloading the Billboard Top 100 in 2019 because it was all mumble rap and reggaeton – formulaic garbage, as Rick Beato explains in every 'Top 10 Songs' video. Luckily in 2024 that pandemic has ended with the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, et al.

[Rick Beato \(YouTuber\)](https://preview.redd.it/6gas0s0md03e1.jpg?width=788&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb5b9501af842e90cf8c4c19521b53d96181569f)

But this Korean chart dive?  It was like a time warp back to when pop music had actual variety.  Remember when you could hear Nelly one minute and Nelly Furtado the next?  This is giving me those vibes.  Speaking of which, doesn't this song by Andr give you major early 2000s feels?

[https://youtu.be/awrAVacj-f0?si=-990xunpp8sUVlgu](https://youtu.be/awrAVacj-f0?si=-990xunpp8sUVlgu)

Anyway, after sifting through the sonic chaos, I managed to curate a K-pop mega mix of 134 tracks (about 30%) that I’d actually listen to without wanting to gouge my ears out.

**EXO:**  Holy shit, where have these guys been all my life?  They’re incredible!  No wonder they’re legends.  Deep dive incoming, because their sound is S-Class, no cap.

**fromis\_9:** Seriously, these girls are criminally underrated.  They remind me of the best kep1er b-sides (which, let’s be honest, are the best part of kep1er).  Whoever is keeping them in the dungeon needs to be locked up in a real medieval dungeon.  I'm only *slightly* joking.

**IU:**  Okay, okay, I get it.  She’s the gold standard.  But why am I fighting back tears every time she sings?  Is this what being an adult is like?  Help!

**IVE:**  I admit, I avoided them like the plague after their debut.  Then I saw their Lollapalooza performance on a whim and… yeah, just like JYP I’m a changed man.  Amazing songs, killer vocals, stage presence for days.

[Yes, I kept this song. No, not ironically.](https://preview.redd.it/eq2agdg0f03e1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adc99d32e72e2499d088f479bef269417a95135e)

Speaking of Lolla…

**HOT TAKE:**  Who was better at Lollapalooza: IVE or NewJeans?  Fight me in the comments.

**NewJeans Lolla Review:**  Still can’t get enough of this smoked-out dude’s review of NewJeans at Lolla.  His enthusiasm is infectious:

**The Boyz - LIP GLOSS:**  This song is corny as hell, like pure syrupy-sweet diabetes in audio form.  But it’s also fun as shit, and all the boys should blast this from their Honda Civics with the windows down.  Don't @ me.

**Boy Groups in General:**  Being a GG stan, I’ve been sleeping on boy groups.  TXT, EXO, Enhypen…  Damn, I’ve missed out on some bangers.  Gotta fix that.

kpopthoughts,1gxdeup,2024-11-22 18:35:43,Views about Fans choice Daesang in MAMA'24,"There's a lot going on about the Daesang. Engenes saying MAMA is rigged bc Enhypen didn't take the trophy home but then Jimin is a huge name. BTS has been taking the trophy home since forever and always because they deserved it. Jimin's solo releases were also breaking records so idk why is even being targeted. Though I feel engenes, I really don't see the results being rigged, unfavorable or simply false.",260,381
kpopthoughts,1gxnvtv,2024-11-23 02:18:17,"What does it mean or what are your thoughts when different measurements of success/charting don't necessarily ""match"" for a group?","For example, if they get many more streams than sales, or more votes than streams, etc. I feel like it's common for boy groups to be stronger with sales and girl groups are stronger with streams, but I'm also curious about like touring data or fan-voted awards like MAMA. Is it surprising when, for example, a group's music is well streamed but their concert tickets don't sell out or they book small venues, etc. ?

This isn't shade by any means and I don't doubt any group's popularity, it's just something I noticed and thought was interesting to me. I remember seeing examples of this on Twitter.. but honestly I can't think of anything else specific. The reason I made this post though is because of Enhypen: the fanbase seems extremely strong for voting and I was a little jealous I'm not gonna lie, but it doesn't seem to ""match"" for touring data? 

Again to reiterate I don't mean this to doubt popularity or shade any groups, I'm not familiar with Enhypen, it was just something I personally noticed and thought was interesting but confusing. I feel like, wouldn't fans want to support in any/all ways possible? ",2,23

For me, My favourite performances BND, Toenze, Treasure and TXT's stages. 

BND was absolutely fantastic! Their stage presence was insane! I loved their stage direction, how they used their dancers, their props, their VCR, even their camerawork was really good! 

ToEnZe stage was so good! All the memebrs with their instruments was amazing and I genuinely wish we could see them perform again cos they were soooo good!

Treasure totally hyped up the stage and I'm not even a fan but their energy was insane! I loved how they engaged with the crowd and even the artists. See them vibing with BND was sooo cool!

TXT was amazing! I really loved their performance and their stage was just so pretty! I loved that they perfomaned the Anemoia remix for Deja Vu, totally well fitting for stages like this! I really liked their outfits as well. It was sad that Soobin could not perform, but they still did amazing regardless! I'm sure Soobin must be really proud!




What were your overall thoughts on the show, fav performances, audience reactions, the positives, the disappointing aspects etc.?

Some of the commonly talked about ones are Jungwon of Enhypen, Chaehyun of Kep1er, Natty leaving both SM and JYP, etc.

The other way around seems to be much less common. Are there any idols who didn’t get to debut in their original company/groups they were slated for, who then did debut under SM? ",5,41
kpopthoughts,1gwyhvu,2024-11-22 04:29:13,I am honestlt really excited for this year mama,"I know mama isn’t the best, but im honestly really excited for it, I haven’t been this excited for mama since maybe 2020. The line up in my opinion is pretty good actually, better than last year for sure in my opinion. Rose and Bruno Mars will be making her mama debut stage, Aespa is returning to the mama stage for the first time since 2021, and G-Dragon will be performing for the first time in mama since 2015. Looking how there will be three locations I am assuming that it will be similar to mama 2018(the golden days oh my god nothing can ever top mama 2018 as a whole).

Mama USA which as im writing this starts in literally 29 minutes with the lineup being Anderson .Paak, Illit, ﻿﻿J. Y. Park, ﻿﻿Katseye, ﻿﻿Riize, ﻿﻿TWS, and ﻿﻿Young Posse. Looking at lineup it looks like it will focus more on rookies(like mama 2018) and while they didn’t specify, I assume they will announce some awards. Rookie of the year for both female and male might be announce since the winners are in attendance, the might give out some of the favorite(attendance) awards plus the professional awards like best song writer, etc. i am not really familiar with any of the groups and I have to admit im not really that excited about mama usa but I want to see if Jyp makes a fool out of himself so I will probably tune in for that, plus I wanna see illit perform lucky girl syndrome I love that song.

Mama Japan which will take place like 7 or 8 hours after which I personally find that dumb, like couldn’t they make all days be atleast 1 day apart from each other? The lineup for mama japan day 1 will consist of BoyNextDoor, Bruno Mars, Enhypen, Ive, Izna, Lee Young-ji, ME:I, Plave, Rosé, Treasure, and Tomorrow X Together, with a special band performance from Enhypen, Txt, and Zb1. Day 2 will probably be the fan choice day as I like to call it since they will give out 20 bonsangs(since they will be 10 male and female winners this year) which will take out most of the time, the daesang, and some of the favorite awards. Now for me this is were the true fun begins, the line up is pretty stacked as we can see. Ive, I was so dissapointed they didn’t go last year since I wanted to see what they would do with I am but im happy they are back, Izna will be making their debut stage. You can never go wrong with Treasure, Txt, and Enhypen so I am thrilled to see that along with the special band performamce. Now what most people are probably the most excited for this year, Rose and Bruno mars perfoming Apt live together for the first time. Rose will be making her mama debut stage since debuting which is exciting, I know there was rumors circulating she would show up for the last two weeks but its amazing to see they were true.

Mama japan day 2 will consist of (G)-die, Aespa, Bibi, Byeon Woo-seok, G-Dragon, INI, Meovv, Seventeen, and Zerobaseone(which are the only reason im even going to be watching it live). Gidle will be performing the mega stage once again which is exciting I most day since they killed it last yeae, Aespa will be making their return to the mama stage, Zerobaseone will be performing the cinematic stage this year which I am literally so Excited for it like I know I am biased as hell but I know it will be one of the best performances of this year mama. Seventeen will be performing this year once again which I am happy atleast pne of the mama staples will be in attendance, plus gdragon will be performing for the first time in mama since 2015. Now this is when the best categories will be given plus the three big daesangs which I might add thank god the winners will be in attendance because last year only one of the 4 winners were in attendance. Another solid day, im sorry but I literally cant wait for zb1’s performance I am excited.

Now while I am excited that doesn’t mean I am happy with everything. I don’t like how mama usa and mama japan day 2 are literally only 7 hours apart from each other, I felt like it was a better idea to make them a day apart and mama japan day 1 on a saturday. Plus the mama top 10 this year, I don’t really like how they divided it but I guess they did since pretty much boy groups always took up the entire top 10, Twice was the only female artist to win last year. Also some of the snubs but im not going to talk about thay. Now I know the line up is not as good as the others of course, I most admit I miss seeing Twice, Bts, and mamamoo since they were the mama staples but atleast its not that bad.",6,4
kpopthoughts,1gu6a4m,2024-11-18 15:43:33,Is it really difficult to hold K-pop concerts in Australia???,"Inspired by my previous post from... r/enhypen. **Today, BELIFT announced Enhypen ""WALK THE LINE"" tour stops for Bulacan and Bangkok. The boys are currently on their third tour in a relatively short period compared to other boy groups.**

Enhypen has an American member, Jay, and they have included Seattle in their tour stops. They also have a Japanese member, NIKI, who is the most popular fourth-generation idol in Japan, so much so that they've included all the major domes for their tours there. Additionally, they have an Australian member, Jake, but surprisingly, there have been no concert stops, not even fan meetings or appearances at music festivals, or television appearances. 

Stray Kids (SKZ), who debuted in 2018, are only now embarking on their third world tour. Their previous MANIAC world tour covered similar regions as Enhypen's, specifically in North America and Asia. However, SKZ also included stops in Australia, performing in Sydney—the hometown of both Bang Chan and Felix—and Melbourne. They have even returned to the same locations for their Dominate World Tour.

I wondered why that was and reviewed the tour catalogues of other HYBE groups, including Seventeen, TXT, BTS and non-HYBE groups. **It appears that the issue lies more with HYBE than with Belift. So far, TXT, like ENHYPEN, has not included any stops in Australia. Seventeen had a concert there once, which was before the HYBE acquisition. Additionally, BTS last performed in Sydney and Melbourne around 2016-2017.** But, other companies have sent at least one of their acts to Australia for concerts, with JYP sending the most. **Following are the K-pop companies and the artists they sent for concerts and fan meetings at least once in Oceania.**

**JYP: GOT7, DAY6, TWICE, ITZY, STRAY KIDS**

**SM: AESPA**

**YG: Blackpink ( for both the world tours, 2018-20 and 2022-23)**

**HYBE: BTS and SEVENTEEN (up to 2017)**

**Non-big4 Kpop groups: IVE, G-IDLE, ATEEZ (So far, I have checked if there is anyone I have missed, Kindly let me know.)**

If JYP, SM, YG, Cube, and Starship can hold concerts in Australia, why can’t HYBE do the same? Seventeen hasn’t had a stadium tour, and Enhypen, which includes an Australian member, has not toured there either. Hybe is experiencing touring issues in Europe, which I understand, but Australia too? Does Australia have the same problems as Europe? Does anyone have answers?",68,53

kpopthoughts,1gvwa0q,2024-11-20 19:23:05,Hating on HYBE groups is getting way too normalised,"Specifically with Le Sserafim and Illit, they have some of the most intense hate trains I have seen in a while. And in general, its like the Kpop sphere has no idea how to separate artists from the company. Its obvious that resentment had been building for a while, if we look at the discourse around HYBE vocals. But recently since the release of the report, things have just exploded. I specifically feel terrible for the girl groups, because they get hated on no matter what they do, and ngl I do find NewJeans and their fans very annoying, because they have just been victimising themselves without considering for a second what impact their actions have. But while the fans can unequivocally be declared idiots, I think the girls are just very very brain-washed and sheltered, if they think not saying hi can amount to bullying. I really hope they can get the support and distance they need so they can objectively look at the situation and understand their position really is not as horrible as they are making it out to be, unless there are some major bombshells they are holding out on. This is not hate to NewJeans, clearly they are going through stuff and I hope they can get some time away from public eye to recuperate and reflect.

Le Sserafim is clearly trying to appeal to a more international audience now so more power to them but the recent Illit comeback has really unleashes the most brain dead, loud Kpop stans to the forefront. Suddenly, everyone is feeling for the NewJeans members, and the problems they have faced as female minors, while what happens to others is ""karma"". And the hate train isnt just going to the girls, it has hit TXT, Enhypen and BTS too. As a TXT stan, the kind of straight up ragging their newest comeback has received, and the vitriol the members are getting online is genuinely shocking. All of it gets normalized in a ""yass queen take down the evil corporation"" way that people online think is empowerment, and its a little disheartening to see just how quickly people have switched to dehumanizing and hating on idols who have done nothing wrong.

Of course this is nothing new for the Kpop fandom, but the sheer acceptance of it online is something I haven't really seen before. I really hope this dies down in a bit, but realistically, if things don't work out for NewJeans which there is a very real possibility, will not, the hate train will be back in full force.

Tldr; People have gotten way too comfortable hating on other Hybe groups in the name of ""justice"" for NewJeans

Edit: Y'all, I don't know how many times I have to explain, I'm not hating on NewJeans. As I and many other commenters have already said, they are very young and obviously being manipulated by the people they trust, and that's not their fault at all. I still have the right to say I feel annoyed by the consequences of their actions, without getting accused of encouraging a hate train.

Okay, time for the other interesting things. DK released a very lovely cover of Adam Levine's [Lost Stars](https://youtu.be/LfOe8NCCrQo?si=wmoJ5eX3V9-4-rhB). Ilhoon announced his first single(?) since 2019 (set for Nov 21). I'm assuming it's a single. If I missed any covers, do let me know. 

My favorite of this batch of new songs has to be TIOT's *Take It Slow*. Despite its length, I was swept away by their incredible voices and the huggable instrumentals.

Thank you all once more. You're fantastic and lovely.

Fun fact for the day, considering the nearest large body of water to where I live is saltwater, less than 3% of Earth's water is freshwater, and most of that is frozen in glaciers and ice caps.",9,0
kpopthoughts,1gm6yyu,2024-11-08 02:31:08,"I don’t know why I have to say this, but assuming idols are straight and homophobic for no reason is wrong","There is something I keep seeing being said about enhypen for as far as back 2021, particularly in certain online queer kpop communities. And I kept debating if I should say something about it, but recently, I saw another one of these comments. And I think it has happened way too many times for me to overlook it. 

And it always go something like this. 
Someone would ask what they think about enhypen, and another person would answer with something along the lines of, “Enhypen is STRAIGHTEST group I ever know. Everyone is sooo straight except Sunoo. I feel sooo bad for him. He is stuck with all these straight people. I mean we don’t know what goes on behind doors, I bet they are all homophobic and exclude him all the time. Poor him, I hope he can be himself.” And sometimes they’ll add something about how their company staff must be all homophobic too. 


I usually don’t have anything against speculating 
about idols’ sexuality, but isn’t this taking it way too far? I would expect that even online, if you are talking about something so personal about someone else, that you would be a little more respectful. I thought we as a community have some sort of agreement that we don’t go around assuming people we don’t know are straight. And if you think the homophobic part is an exaggeration, it is not. Its like they all have the same script. And I started seeing it back in 2021 when they were all teenagers. Imagine being a teenager or a young adult, and going online to see all these people who don’t know you talking about how you are straight and homophobic for absolutely no reason! 

I don’t understand why anyone thinks this is okay.",385,118
kpopthoughts,1gj9ow8,2024-11-04 09:35:17,I really love Illit and Enhypen. The way they push through the noise with hard work is inspiring.,"Their company is engaged in legal fights right now, but this isn't about that. This is just a shoutout because I can't help but notice how much these two groups are maturing.


I started out as a casual fan of ILLIT. I liked their debut tracks, and tbh I felt pity for them with everything happening. But after watching Idol 1N2D, I’m now a real fan of the members too, not just their music.


For those who haven’t seen it, Iroha cried on the show, feeling grateful for the warmhearted staff and because of how much fun she had. I literally teared up too. They’ve faced so much hate just for existing, and it’s honestly inspiring to see them stay grounded and grateful through it all.


ENHYPEN has had a rough time too. Fans are calling for boycotts and asking ENHYPEN to get rest, while the members keep telling their fans to please trust them and wait. And now we’re seeing what they meant.


ENHYPEN’s in the middle of a transformation—their concept, music, dynamics, and performances all feel different now. It’s starting to show in their ongoing tour and their upcoming comeback. They just dropped “Daydream” which made us fans gagged and speechless. It feels like the start of a new chapter for them. They’re experimenting, trying, and they’re not giving up.


Despite everything, ILLIT and ENHYPEN are changing right in front of us and pushing forward. Their mental fortitude and humility is so moving to witness. Hate and noise be damned. 


**Edit:** I'm not listening to any boycott agenda. Leave that shit at X. Recently, Jungwon went to his hometown for a vacation and today he went to the movies with his family. They're getting rest and reassuring us they're excited.",302,24

kpopthoughts,1giy2na,2024-11-03 22:42:08,A Summary of my Agency Group Title Track Findings,"For all of those who are unaware, I have been making a deeply unpopular ranking series in which I look at all of the main agencies in k-pop and rank their groups title tracks from 1-10.  In total this was about 1,227 songs spanning roughly 30 years, as well as a wide variance in quality.  But this post is mostly just for those nerds among you who want to see the general findings and maybe some highlights and lowlights I found along the way.  When discussing each company, I'll be sure to link the individual rankings along with it.

  
**Averages**

The first thing I would like to look at is the quality of the average title track that I ranked by company.  

[JYP](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1e9a6w1/every_jyp_idol_group_title_track_ranked_im_pretty/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\-6.65

[SM](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1dh37qz/ranking_every_sm_title_track_to_the_best_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\-6.92

[HYBE](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1ehpurf/every_hybe_idol_group_title_track_i_hope_really/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\-6.95

[YG](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1dv2g3m/every_yg_idol_group_title_track_ranked_i_think/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\-7.11

[Cube](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1gighmr/every_cube_group_title_track_ranked_final/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\-7.19

Now I will say, after listening to all of the music, I actually think I like SM music the most.  A lot of what drags them back for me is the age of their music meaning a lot of their earlier work just doesn't hold up as well as you'd want it to, and also NCT 127 makes some whack ass music sometimes.  I feel like Cube and JYP are going to be some of the more consistently enjoyable music with relatively little truly top tier songs , and HYBE and YG are going to have a lot more variance in the quality of their music in my eyes.  However the truly fun part is below, where I have created the Hall of Shame and Hall of Fame respectively.  

  
**Hall of Shame**

For this section, I have organized every song I have ranked either a 2 or a 1 and then have them going from best to worst to see what songs I find truly repugnant.  If a song you like is on here, just know that you are objectively wrong because this list said so (do not [fact check](https://youtu.be/vGuJuW0bDWA?si=radI9wj1P_IIpOru&t=35) that).

  
11. Pink Venom (BlackPink)

10. Whistle (BlackPink)-Both this and Pink Venom aren't as bad as this would make it seem, they just annoy me for some reason

9. Sheesh (BabyMonster)-Trash ass final chorus

8. Sneakers (ITZY)

7. A-Yo (NCT 127)-Being an experimental group has its downsides

6. Asobo (NiziU)

5. Lollipop (BigBang and 2NE1)-The betrayal of these two amazing groups making this trash hurts the most honestly

4. Zero (NewJeans)-The chorus really did it in

3. Around the World (Got7)-What the FUCK

2. Punch (NCT 127)-NCT 127 really can't help themselves, can they?

1. O.O (NMIXX)-This song is an abomination unto creation and the Lord shall surely punish us for it

  
**Hall of Fame**

Same rules as last time, just now we're looking for peak music.  Now for this one I did add some new music that had not yet released when I made the previous rankings, as well as reviewed some of the music that I thought I may have graded too harshly, so while that was not factored into averages it will be factored into this.  Now the Hall of Fame is exclusively 10s, and something worth quickly noting is the fact that these are *incredibly* volatile rankings for me.  Outside of the top of the top and the bottom of the bottom (think top and bottom 3 or so) these rankings change by the hour.  So at this exact second, this is how I would arrange it, even if it broadly looks like this most of the time.

33. Lose my Breath (Stray Kids)-It eeked in

32. Let's Not Fall in Love (BigBang)

31. I Think I (Super Junior)

30. Without You (NCT U)

29. Lion Heart (Girls Generation) 

28. Drunk Dazed (Enhypen)

27. I'm Serious (Day6)

26. The Eve (EXO)-I know it's not a title track but I originally ranked it as one so it stays

25. Walk (NCT 127)

24. Violet (Pentagon)

23. Serenade (BoyNextDoor)

22. Night Before the End (Xdinary Heroes)

21. Do or Not (Pentagon)

20. Celebrate (Twice)-Still heat

19. Daisy (Pentagon)

18. Zombie (Day6)

17. Fiction (BEAST)-It's like Zombie but slightly better

16. Ready to Love (Seventeen)

15. What is Love (Twice)

14. Haru Haru (BigBang)

13. Beautiful Pain (BTOB)

12. Maniac (Stray Kids)

11. Candy (H.O.T.)

10. Panorama (iKon)-I honestly didn't know iKon had it like that

9. Spring Day (BTS)

8. Last Dance (BigBang)-It really climbed since I last ranked it

7. Baby Don't Stop (NCT U)

6. Black Swan (BTS)

5. Bad Alive (WayV)-I would argue but they're bad kinda players so I probably don't want to cross them

4. Mirotic (TVXQ!)-I mean it's all in the last chorus but sometimes that's enough

3. Russian Roulette (Red Velvet)-***HEART BEAT BEAT BEAT***

2. Monster (EXO)-It really is peak music, I legitimately have a hard time finding a flaw

1. Q&A (Seventeen)-Fight me in real life I don't care

  
So those are the overall findings from these rankings!  After this I'll be looking into the Big 3 soloists and subunits, but I have no idea when I'll get around to doing that.  Until then, hope you like it.",7,25
kpopthoughts,1gfaowy,2024-10-30 02:02:05,10 years in kpop and I certainly have a type😂,"As what I have mentioned in the title, I certainly have a type of group coz the groups I like have common denominators. I mean, EXO made me interested in Kpop 10 years ago, Seventeen piqued my interest. Super Junior during the pandemic. And now, Enhypen and ZeroBaseOne. I also watch other boy groups and individuals (Key, Changsub, Bambam, etc.) variety shows since I'm more into variety shows but they're definitely among the top.

As for girl groups, I like SNSD, Blackpink, Red Velvet, Mamamoo, Aespa and Kiss of Life. I'm also interested with Twice and been watching some videos of them.

Any recommendations of funny variety shows please since I have a lot of time😂

kpopthoughts,1gduoty,2024-10-28 06:21:00,The Mathematically Ideal Amount Of Members,"Recently for fun I decided to calculate the average number of members in the best-performing Kpop groups.

For boy groups, I used BTS, SKZ, Exo, Bigbang, Seventeen, Got7, TXT, Super Junior, NCT 127, NCT Dream, Enhypen, and Shinee as reference.

For girl groups, I used Blackpink, Twice, Itzy, (G)I-DLE, RV, Aespa, Mamamoo, SNSD, Newjeans, Gfriend, and IVE.

I chose these groups based on various factors such as total album sales, mv views, wins, etc.

The boy group average ended up being 7.66, meaning around 7-8 members is the ideal.

The girl group average was 5.73, meaning 5-6 members is the ideal. Though, it’s probably best to stick to 5 if you believe in the 6 member curse.

What can we conclude from this data? Women bad (a heavy /j here).

Feel free to make any other actually valuable conclusions from this info in the comments.

kpopthoughts,1g2g6xn,2024-10-13 04:48:36,Enhypen changed. I feel like I'm watching a new group and I'm gagged!,"Enhypen's entire chemical being changed after the FATE Tour ended and I'm gagged.


Lately, especially the past two months, something changed. I guess it's because the FATE Tour ended, which was a really exhausting and controlled tour. I'm not exaggerating how different they are now. 


I'm writing this post because Heeseung covered ""Can't Feel My Face"" by The Weeknd at Music Bank Madrid. I can't stop watching it. I don't know what's happening but Heeseung's stage gave me goosebumps. Heeseung has done covers before but this one is on another level. The voice? Dance? The swagger and attitude?? He's performing like he has everyone wrapped around his finger and it's crazy magnetic. [Link to his fancam.](https://x.com/enhypenupdates/status/1845189744495305048?s=19)


I'm getting chills just from a fancam at how amazing he is. He's exuding confidence, and the years of experience accumulated through too-long tours, and the passion of not giving up is manifesting themselves lately.


Guys, I'm really amazed at how Enhypen's growth. They keep surprising me. I'm gagged how different they are after FATE tour ended. All their stages feel different. Their facial expressions and the way they dance, I can't recognize them anymore. I feel like I'm watching a new group??? Their styling has also become more mature. Their cutest member, Sunoo, is also giving off a more mature vibe. They're all different from before.


They're levelling up like crazy, I can bet on this.",216,43

That being said, I tend to focus on groups the most when they have a comeback and/or are currently promoting. An example being Enhypen, recently I've been so involved in other groups content that they were kinda on the back burner, but now that none of my favs are currently promoting, I'm going back and watching all their released content and I'm falling for them all over again. It's such an enjoyable and relaxing feeling honestly.",26,6
kpopthoughts,1fwtzxi,2024-10-05 18:16:15,"I have goosebumps because ENHYPEN leveled up with their ""Walk The Line"" tour??","Appreciation post incoming. No drama, just fangirling!


""Walk the Line"" tour just started and it's only been one day so far, but ya'll—I have goosebumps. **How is it possible for a group to give off such a different vibe after only a month??**


I haven't felt goosebumps like these in so long. I was scared how they'd do because of the rumors of their exhaustion but tbh, I was proven wrong. YES, they may be tired but it's obvious now this is something they poured their hearts and souls into.



First of all, ENHYPEN, the members themselves, are **producers of this entire tour**. This means they got to choose the stage design, the concept, the setlist, choreos, the ments—everything, and it's giving me major goosebumps. Just from watching the clips online, **they've leveled up by 10x over**.


Maybe it's because they were finally given creative control, but **they look completely in their element**. The singing is live, the band is live, the dancing, the new choreography—everything is on point. And the setlist? It’s just divine. And can we talk about the transitions to the next song?? Their charisma is killing me!



You can also tell they are finally pacing themselves in a way that won’t destroy their bodies, but they’re still giving crazy performances. Their energy was through the roof. They were having so much fun, and honestly, they look so powerful. I almost don't recognize who they are. How can a group change so much in a month?? BELIFT was really holding them back this whole time. **How can a group give off such a different vibe after taking control??**


I'm so glad BELIFT is finally giving the group their dues because they deserve to perform as the artists they want to be, and they’re shining like crazy. I feel inspired to be honest.


Also, I just have to shout out the costumes, the hair, and the makeup—it’s like nothing they’ve done before, and I cannot look away at all.



What really stands out is how much they've grown as artists. The experience and hard work they’ve accumulated over the years can be felt in every aspect of their performance. They’ve evolved into true artists who know how to take full control of the stage and deliver a show at the highest level.


I'm hoping they they have a successful rest of the ""Walk The Line"" tour with only happiness from their hard-work and no injuries. 🙏

kpopthoughts,1g0hfzp,2024-10-10 14:17:48,Your Favorite Album(s) or EPs from Your Favorite K-Pop Artists?,"I love exchanging tastes in music and as someone who is particularly obsessed with albums and EPs, I love discussing the ""best"" of artists discographies but ofc as humans we have differing tastes and opinions so I love talking about that too :) 

Basically, this is a chance to contrast and compare our favorites bodies of works from artists that we might have in common or it'll be a chance to find new music! Highly rec to listen to any body of work I mention :)

Here are some of my favorites from the artists I tend to enjoy listening the most/most often (in no particular order):

* **The Boyz - Be Awake EP (2023)** 
   * reasons: I love all six tracks; it's my first comeback with TBZ; I love how the concept was executed in the music and visuals
   * they are my ults :) 
* **EXO - EXIST (2017)** 
   * reasons: love all of the songs; this is the kind of music I'd love for most boy groups to make and idc that a lot of EXOLs didn't like it lol
   * again, happens to be my first comeback with EXO :')
   * if I didn't dislike Chill then The War would've been here (and I don't like Power either from The War: POM) 
* **Red Velvet - I can't put just one sorry** 
   * The Red (2015), Feel My Rhythm (2022) and Chill Kill (2023)
   * but also The Red Summer, RBB and The Perfect Red Velvet
   * reasons: bc they're all perfect :) 
* **Loona - XX (2019)**
   * reasons: one of the best albums ever to grace my ears and there is legit nothing I would change, i was skeptical of the girlies until I listened to this
   * stan the members new stuff :) 
   * and fuck BBC
* **GWSN - The Park in The Night, Part 3 (2019)** 
   * reasons: simply put: glittery perfection they are f(x)'s nieces and bc Night Aviation is on here
   * GWSN has one of the best discography's in all of 4th gen 
   * rip GWSN :'(
* **BTS - Love Yourself: Tear (2018)**
   * reasons: could've put HYYH: forever young too tbh but Tear is perfect too so it's fine; my comfort group <333 
   * BTS got me into K-pop during the pandemic so they'll always have a special place in my heart <3
* **Baekhyun - Bambi (2021)**
   * reasons: it's a masterpiece 
* **RM - mono, (2018)**
   * reasons: comfort album, I have listened to this an un-Godly amount of times, I need Namjoon to tell me everything will be okay 
* **Nayeon - I'm Nayeon (2023)**
   * reasons: this has had me on a chokehold since it was released and I can't get out like this is the most perfect debut album for any soloist every in this essay I will-

Anyways, excited to see your guys' favorite albums from your faves! I could've added more here but I wanted to keep it to the groups I listen to most often, but shoutout to NCT 127, Enhypen, CIX, TXT, Seventeen, WJSN, STAYC, IVE, fromis\_9 and aespa :) ",14,64
kpopthoughts,1fwaquj,2024-10-04 23:46:18,"If you could instantly create a well-moderated and popular kpop subreddit, what would it be?","Okay, okay, I know it is absolutely possible to create whatever subreddit you want, but actually getting enough people to join to have an active subreddit would take so much time and effort. Not to mention the constant uphill battle that is moderation! Finding people who want to dedicate much precious time to do an unpaid and completely thankless job in the first place seems impossible.

So if you could skip all that, and just magically create a kpop subreddit that was popular, active and well-moderated without any effort from you, what would you want it to be?

I've been thinking about this for a while for some reason so I have a few:

**kpopGGthoughts**

I enjoy this sub don't get me wrong! But it feels whenever there's a general discussion post - something like ""which idol would you love to interview"" or ""which idol has the best airport fashion"", etc. - it's harder to find people commenting about girl groups among a sea of responses about boy groups. Heck, even on a post asking for specifically girl group songs/female idols, it's not uncommon to have upvoted responses to do with boy groups. It's unfortunate but it makes sense: there are just more people who passionately stan boy groups than girl groups.

Plus, I feel like on other social media sites, there's more of a girl group stan community? Fanwars aside, there's so many huge twitter accounts that are centered around girl groups in general. ""Kpop moments to kill a sapphic"", ""nugupromoter"", ""kpop gg charts"", and many, many more! Some of these accounts have boy group counterparts - or even spinoffs! - but they are usually far less popular. (Again, this makes complete sense, girl groups tend to have many, many casual fans who like other girl groups too whereas boy groups tend to have strong core fandoms.)

So I think having a subreddit focused on having discussions about girl groups in general would make a lot of sense!

**Something like** r/SwiftlyNeutral **for kpop**

So as the subreddit name suggests, r/SwiftlyNeutral is a place designed to discuss Taylor Swift in a more neutral way; you can praise Taylor or criticise her, all *good faith* opinions are welcome and discussed. I enjoy the subreddit even though I don't follow or listen to Taylor Swift.

For a kpop sub inspired by this, I guess you could say it would sorta be like the uncensored subreddit we have now but without the censorship problem.

This would probably never work with kpop fans though. Taylor Swift just has a whole other level of fandom that allows this kind of subreddit to be incredibly active and pretty interesting. Plus, we're lowkey just too messy for this? Critical opinions from kpop fans tend to be more hateful/plain nasty than constructive.

I guess this type of sub only works if it's centered on one artist, which brings me to my next subreddit idea...

r/Enhypenthoughts **for every group**

Honestly, I don't keep up with Enhypen at all so I don't know how or why this subreddit came to be. And I assume the reason why I rarely seem to see Enhypen posts on kpopthoughts is probably because engenes prefer to post on Enhypenthoughts rather than here - so having these type of subreddits might actually decrease traffic to kpopthoughts which would suck...

But every now and then a ""hot"" post from r/Enhypenthoughts will end up on my home feed and I often find them pretty interesting!

So many group subreddits are only really useful for news posts. Every now and then a more discussion-based post will gain some traction, but most of them get buried by instagram posts or press releases. So it would be great to have separate subs for more conversation-based posts about a specific group, aimed at people who are all interested in that group.

**Anyways, what do you guys think?**",32,36
kpopthoughts,1fvea3p,2024-10-03 20:14:55,What are some songs that are sonically perfect to you?,"Songs that just have that thing about then and don't just hype you up but sound like honey to your ears.  I mean truly, sonically, perfect songs not just any song that gets you jumping. 

_Mellifluous: (of a sound) pleasingly smooth and musical to hear._

When I think of such these songs come to mind:

-Super Juinior, Lo Siento

Sweet from start to finish. The guitar, the feature, the pacing, everything. 

-Shinee, View

Feels so much like the summer song it was meant to be. Brings back memories that you never had, but want so bad. It feels so layered to me, even in terms of message. Every good decision that could have been made with the song, including in terms of sound was made. 

-TVXQ, Spellbound

A lot of SMTown here because they understand that vocals make a big difference in how a song is perceived. You can never go wrong with rich vocals. 

-CIX, 458

Everything but the rap is so beuatiful. 

-Ailee, I'll show you

A real classic. 

-EXO, Moonlight, Thunder, Fall, Sign, Galaxy, DMUMT, etc Can you tell why I am a fan of EXO yet. 

-AKMU, Melted

I don't listen to this song so much because it's just so sad, but it's a truely perfect song. 

-IKON, Killing Me

-Enhypen, Drunk - Dazed, Bite Me

The only flaw of bite me is not having a bridge, but somehow that keeps you hooked to the song. 

-(G)idle, Queencard

-Apink, %%

-T-ara, Number 9

-Miss A, Touch


-Sistar, Alone

-Apink, Something ",38,120
kpopthoughts,1fvsh63,2024-10-04 08:08:43,"""Talent"" and its misuse/weaponisation in kpop","Some kpop stans are obsessed with talent and (kind of) don't know what it means and sling it around as an insult calling others ""untalented"". And ik it's not just kpop but being ""untalented"" shouldn't be used as ammunition because it's normal, most people are untalented.

Does that mean I'm asking for less talented trainees to debut? No, absolutely not. I like seeing how people can push the boundaries to put on a spectacle but people need to stop harassing the untalented ones and I think some appreciation would go a long way for those who put their heart and soul into those who pursue their dreams despite being ""gifted"".

A lot of creatives will tell you how much they despise the word ""talent"". The definition of talent I'm using here encompasses something you either have or don't have that allows you to get really good at a skill a lot faster than the average person or allowing to perform something related in that skillset past a certain stronghold that normal people can't get past. And yes it does exist ☹️👍

Let me preface this: YOU STILL NEED TO WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE IT DESPITE HAVING TALENT.

A lot of idols *are* talented in dance/vocal/rap/stage presence (bts jungkook, soloist lee chaeyeon, SHINee taemin, red velvet seulgi, etc.) and they obviously deserve praise but I find it more impressive when somebody who is not talented can become equally as competent.

Also idk it breaks my heart when people say a certain idol didn't deserve to debut because they're ""untalented""

A) because most people they call untalented aren't actually, just unskilled and with a little more polish, they actually can thrive. (Illit wonhee has improved leaps and bounds from r u next) (like damn us actually untalented people r being done dirty here 😭)

B)  people forget these companies choose who debuts based on other things such as personality, star quality and other reasons. (Good ol' fashion lookism sometimes but ig being hot could be a talent in itself /jk) (I can think of twice dahyun, she's my bias and she's very skilled but I wouldn't call her traditionally talented and most people like her for her charms)

C) and last of all, some idols really are just untalented. And there's nothing wrong with that, in fact it should be celebrated that these people work their asses off to stand amongst giants. So when people say they're filler or whatever it's insulting to their efforts. (I can think of a huge example but some people might misunderstand and I don't want that crowd to see this as a hate post)

Not everyone can sing like Nmixx's Lily or dance like enhypen's Ni-ki no matter how much they practice and people need to accept it. So instead of hating those people, go and support the ones who actually can.

Kpop companies treat it as a competition but it doesn't mean us, the fans, should too. We should support our faves and appreciate others' too (as long as they're not problematic)

Thanks for hearing my dumb thoughts out ❤️ - angry aspiring animator",6,6

kpopthoughts,1fml46w,2024-09-22 06:31:04,Looking at longevity through music show wins,"Since a lot of people talk about the longevity of groups, I decided to take a look at music show wins to see how they reflect on a group’s longevity. Music show wins aren’t a perfect metric, but they take into account both domestic and international popularity, as well as casual and dedicated support, through sales, digitals, and votes. However, music show wins are not a perfect metric because they don’t take into account the timing of a comeback. Some other factors that make music show wins an imperfect indicator: Boy groups are at a disadvantage due to military service. Digitals usually tend to be more important, so domestically popular groups that do well on charts have an advantage. Groups from bigger companies tend to get their first win sooner, giving them an advantage. Some groups disband despite their popularity due to the end of their contract.

The gap between the first and latest music show wins usually indicates how long a group has been “popular” whether with the domestic GP and casual listeners or through sustaining a fanbase. But there are some groups that have been gone on hiatus, and then had a comeback years later and won.

Some notes:

* The table is sorted by largest to smallest gap between debut and latest win.
* I included duos and subunits, but not soloists or temporary project groups.
* Only groups with 10 or more wins are included.
* The groups with an asterisk are less than 7 years old.
* I might have gotten some dates wrong, so please let me know if you find any mistakes and I’ll edit them.

Some interesting notes:

- Kara is the only girl group in the top 10. But it’s more even after the top 10.

- Of the 66 groups older than 7 years, only about half (34) had a win 7 years after their debut.",77,57
kpopthoughts,1fi7o7s,2024-09-16 17:34:46,are there any groups where you struggle to tell apart members' voices on their songs?,"okay so this isn't really about being so new to the group where you can't even tell the members apart, but about if you've heard many songs from the group and still can't tell some members' voices apart due to them sounding very similar.

for me it's multiple. 

Firstly, enhypen. I have heard all of their discography and have been since their debut. I can tell apart their voices when they're normally talking but in songs I can mostly just point out sunghoon, jungwon and sometimes Ni-ki and the rest are really hard to figure out in most songs.

2. ateez. jongho, mingi and hongjoon are really easy to tell apart but the rest sound very similar *to me*. sometimes I can point out San and then I'm like ""was that really San or was it wooyoung?"" and they're also a group whose voices I can clearly tell apart when they're talking but not in songs.

3. riize. I can tell almost all apart except eunseok & sungchan at times and in their older songs seunghan along with them.

4. new jeans. okay their voices aren't that similar to each other but I find a hard time connecting their vocals to their normal voices and hence can't figure out who's singing which part even though I can tell when a part switches to a different member.

sometimes between enha & ateez I can't even tell when/if the members have switched between parts.

it was different with BTS for me. even when i was a very new fan I could clearly tell apart each of them in their songs. the only times I ever struggled was when jungkook, jimin and jin hit high notes together that's when their voices really blend.

I wanted to ask this because a lot of casual fans are able to easily tell apart members for even a few month old group and I still struggle with my long time casuals so I was like ""is this a skill issue? am I stupid?""

edit: fixed a typo",81,199
kpopthoughts,1fhkdve,2024-09-15 21:06:28,Does EXO have different ship/duo names in Korean?,"I hope I'm in the right subreddit. I've been a KPop fan since 2014 and EXO fanfiction really helped with my English back then. I'm learning Korean now, so I wanted to try and see if I can replicate that same result by reading stuff that Korean fans post on Postype.

I also want to read Korean KPop content on Twitter, but not sure how to go about looking for that (aside from looking at Baekhyun's Twitter replies lol)

It's a bit difficult to look for content, though, as I think Korean ship/duo names are different than their English counterparts. I know that this is the case for Enhypen, but I wonder if this is also true for EXO? It'd be really great if you guys can point me to the right direction and perhaps even give me their Korean duo names if you know them 😭

Thank you so much!",2,3
kpopthoughts,1fgp9xw,2024-09-14 17:56:05,Jungkook's unwavering love and support for his juniors is heartwarming,"One of the very first thing Jungkook said when Hybe was created was that he looked forward to having juniors  since BTS themselves never had seniors to look after them (and he probably kind of tired of always being the youngest). He was so excited to have his first [juniors to be proud of with txt](https://x.com/0X1_1304/status/1783563591653945680), constantly [mentioning them in unrelated interviews,](https://youtu.be/yRl4Q-0Oaik?t=82) celebrating [birthdays](https://x.com/PopBase/status/1701888138098946422), shooting [tiktoks](https://x.com/syoogas/status/1713178514156118119) with them and leaving them small [notes](https://x.com/koosjunie/status/1753953624516890913) and even [thoughtful gifts](https://x.com/BTStranslation_/status/1410211902211248131). Their bond is especially heartwarming since Jungkook is not that much older than them, he's only two years older than Yeonjun but you can tell he was glad to be able to act as the doting sunbae for once.

Then came Enhypen, and that one is actually quite funny because the whole reason why his private tiktok account was leaked is because he [shared their seven challenge.](https://x.com/ningikeu/status/1776311048527921405) Iconic user Letjungcook7 would never have seen the light if not for his desire to support and brag about his new juniors. Enhypen also happens to have some of the [loudest JK stans](https://x.com/JJK_Times/status/1346320551095066624) and I'm just so happy that they get to interact positively with their idol who is just as [loudly supportive of them](https://x.com/JJK_Times/status/1341229201978880005). In the biggest Jungkook fanboy competition, Boy Next Door is also quite hight up the ladder and Jungkook seems to[ find them adorable](https://x.com/jianextdoor/status/1684247979983777794). He publically thanked both TXT Taehyun and Boy Next Door Jaehyun for their Seven covers. He keeps their signed album on his[ lil album shelf ](https://x.com/trinhers/status/1687536786384289792)and you can tell how [thankfull they are for their supportive seniors](https://x.com/homeisjungkook/status/1686380477836615680).

While Seventeen only became part of Hybe recently and can't exactly be considered a junior, I think it's fair to say that it's one of the groups Jungkook has shown a lot of public support for, and it's not for nothing that he's called the armycarat president. He has several close friends in SVT and imo deserves his spot as the secret [14th seventeen member.](https://x.com/dailyjmthv/status/1709635696934130121) Not only has he been to their [concerts](https://x.com/minghaoareyou_/status/1775007259208327231) before, he also enjoy [singing](https://x.com/WwangelbabywW/status/1620844908629344256) and [dancing their whole playlist](https://x.com/kopinyoup/status/1733144342909325385/video/1) (worth noting that their two fandoms were in the middle of dumb fanwars). He’s obviously [bestie with Mingyu,](https://x.com/jjklve/status/1676329007715954688) but I find his [friendship with Seungkwan](https://x.com/jiminterludez/status/1798226862117998720) to be also quite unexpected and wholesome.

As far as showing support for his labelmates goes, I think his support for Lesserafim is also noteworthy. He's a pretty big gg stans but he seems to restrict himself more when it comes to showing public support to them, mostly because he's big target for shippers and rumors. However, he's been a vocal fan of their music since their debut, [dancing to their debut song ](https://x.com/jjklve/status/1555874756074905600)and even [singing to their music ](https://x.com/JeonJungkook_BR/status/1635646474296934400)in his lives several time. Of course, the [iconic perfect night tiktok challenge](https://x.com/sserapics/status/1825958004480684042) went pretty viral on the k-side of things but the [SNTY challenge ](https://x.com/JTKblueberry/status/1794448283198222768)they filmed in response is less known yet just as impressive imo. He also interacted with their fan content on tiktok, notably by posting laughing emojis to Chaewon's famous dokdok meme but some antis tried to twist the narrative and used this interaction to call him a predator(??)... (Chaewon is only 3 years younger btw)

As for Newjeans, he’s been a vocal Ditto lover since the song came out, but to be fair he's sang probably half their discography on his lives so it's hard to list all the instances (I remember Super shy, OMG, Hype Boy, tbh I first discovered most of their songs through him lol). He also loves Ditto's [choreo](https://x.com/jeonjkloops/status/1685291435224903680) and ended up filming a [challenge](https://x.com/newtannies/status/1713470675782877445) with the girls loooong after Ditto era was over. He has a signed NJ album on his album shelf as welln and was promoting their songs on his lives more than his own solo work even when they were in direct competition for SOTY.

He follows and supports Hybe artists on his socials despite not being active. He started following ILLIT on Tiktok despite the fact that their debut comeback happened months after he enlisted (and even though he's been pretty much MIA since then). He even covers labelmates from different countries like when he covered [Imase's japanese song, ](https://x.com/jjklve/status/1661870975078596609)and took a picture with him, and with many artists that I can't remember right now.

He's shown a lot of appreciation for artists outside of his company as well, even with artists whose fandoms have  beef with his own fans. I've seen him sing and dance to Exo, Blackpink, and pretty much every YG artists under the sun when the fanwars were at its strongest. There are so many fancams out there of him being supportive during performances or award show speeches that I have more difficulty finding groups he hasn't shown public support for in the past than the opposite (seriously it's like guy knows all the songs bar for bar sometimes...)

He's THE quintessential kpop stan in a way because he listens to everything, girl groups, boy groups, juniors, seniors, even jpop which is why he wrote a couple of their japanese songs. He himself joined BH when he was only 13 yo because he was a huge IU fan and he wanted to shine in a similar way. He already has a 11 year-old careed in the industry and that's because he debuted as a 15 yo with big dreams and a genuine love for his job.

(Needless to say, this post was sort of inspired by the recent instagram post JK made on Bam's account stating that ""artists are not guilty"" but it is NOT meant to address any of that controversy and I would kindly ask you not to comment on this specific topic. This is an appreciation thread for all the support Jungkook has shown over the years for his junior as well as other artists because, to me, it's one of his most endearing trait. I believe that he's a very straightforward person so when he says that he supports ""artists"", he means that and nothing more, he will always take the side of his fellow artists over any company executives).",769,161

All 4th gen groups have shown incredible growth in the past year, as the numbers clearly show! Let me know your thoughts",248,219
kpopthoughts,1f8noqf,2024-09-04 09:57:57,jake from enhypen’s vocals are so underrated,"i've always loved the way jake sings. even though he isn't one of the top 3 best vocalists in enhypen, his vocal tone is so pretty and for some reason, i find it really calming? one example is in 'your eyes only', when he sings 'urimane teukbyeolhan geu eoneo, read more' during the last chorus. the way he sings it is so pure and sweet, it's like pouring honey into your ears. another example is when he sings 'ireon goemul gateun naindedo' during the last chorus in still monster. compared to the previous lines in the song, it just sounds so raw and unique, and really makes the chorus stand out compared to the first two? idk but there's something about his voice that's so sweet and refreshing, which is probably why i love how he narrates in some of their intros too. 

(i sound so obsessive? haha but it's true, i really like his voice lol)",102,21
kpopthoughts,1ff5oy3,2024-09-12 17:43:34,Members Who Are The Gateway For Most Fans,"I've only seen a few groups throughout my time being a k-pop stan where it is so obvious that most people become fans because of one specific member. I'm not saying that the other members aren't as good as this one idol, but people tend to hear about one member, then decide to get into the group based off of their impression of that given member. I'll list some examples and reasonings:

Note: I am mostly a bg stan, so I don't really wanna put any ggs because I am not confident or somewhat involved in their fandom.

**Keeho - P1Harmony**

You cannot tell me that new gen k-pop fans do not know who this man is. I would argue that he was one of the reasons why P1Harmony was not left in nugudom during 2020. You need to remember that they debuted during Covid and quarantine where there was little to no interactions with fans. They also debuted when groups like Aespa, Enhypen and Treasure did. You will consistently see people talk about how ""real"" and funny he is. There was also a lot of solo stans for him. 

  
**Bae Jinyoung - ex-CIX**

An ex-member of the famous Wanna One. In my opinion, Jinyoung in CIX is more eye-catching then him in Wanna One. It's obvious in his charisma and confidence. When CIX debuted, the company clearly pushed Jinyoung as the center and face of the group, watching the mv to *Movie Star* is a dead give away. He went viral later on in his career when he had red hair. Due to his prior experience, he brought many fans into CIX as well.

  
**Myung Jaehyun - Boynextdoor**

Jaehyun, Jaehyun, Jaehyun. The reason why I am making this post. Being a fan of BND pre-debut, it was very clear to me that Jaehyun was very hungry for people's attention. He showcased that on stage and through his interactions with his members and staff. His position as an MC only pushes my opinion forward. He is friendly with various other idols, gaining attention from their fandoms, he is very comedic on variety shows, and has gone viral numerous amounts of time through his covers of other songs. He is probably the 5th gen idol that has the most charisma in my opinion. 

  
I would also like to state that I tend to think of gateway idols to be from not as popular groups. It's kinda hard to say that V is a gateway idol in my opinion due to BTS and V being so well-known within k-pop. However, it could be argued from an outsiders perspective, but when talking about within the k-pop communities, groups like BTS, Stray Kidz, Twice, Blackpink, etc... it's harder to choose an idol as a gateway into their group. If that makes sense.",103,127

kpopthoughts,1fbzrra,2024-09-08 16:59:45,Stats about song production and credits in BG,"Hi everyone, like promised in my survey, here are some stats about song production and credits.

First some disclaimer :

1/ This is something I do to satisfy my curiosity and I don't pretend this is exhaustive nor perfect. I choose the groups based on popularity, on groups known as involved in the production side and in personal interest.

2/ In no way is this a attack or criticism against the groups with few or no credits. Every groups has its own way of  being an idol and there is no right or wrong way. (I'm a fan of Enhypen almost as much as I'm a fan of Stray Kids and Day6).

3/ This is a Boy Group version because this is taking me so much time and I wanted to post it quickly. I'll post the Girl Group version later.

4/ I choose to start at 2nd Gen groups because I didn't find a lot of reliable data on 1st Gen groups.

5/ It's not fully accurate because some company are not fully clear on credits and other don't make a difference between Composing and Arranging (Hybe manly).

My sources are principally the KOMCA site (korean association for copyright), only taking into account groups songs (no solo) : [https://www.komca.or.kr/foreign2/eng2/K0101.jsp](https://www.komca.or.kr/foreign2/eng2/K0101.jsp)

Some quick explanation :

* **Lyrics** (A on the KOMCA site) : the idol participated in writing the lyrics of the song
* **Composing** (C on the KOMCA site) : the idol participated in creating the topline of the song, this is what you sing in a song mostly and some part of the instruments
* **Arranging** (AR on the KOMCA site) : the idol participated in creating the beats of the songs
* **Only Credits** : the members are the only one who contributed to this part of song production

The groups my stats :

* 2nd Generation : 2PM, B.A.P, B1A4, Bigbang, Block B, CN Blue, Highlight (Ex BEAST), Shinee, Super Junior, TVXQ!, Winner
* 3rd Generation : BTOB, BTS, Day6, Exo, GOT7, Ikon, Monsta X, NCT 127 and NCT Dream, Pentagon, Seventeen, VIXX
* 4th Generation : AB6IX, Ateez, Enhypen, Oneus, P1Harmony, Stray Kids, The Boyz, Treasure, TXT, Xdinary Heroes

Here is the link to the stats in details : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cXpIcIy8KTUtDeBOzvVW1C\_oOaZzxP4xmlH70L95t2s/edit?usp=drive\_link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cXpIcIy8KTUtDeBOzvVW1C_oOaZzxP4xmlH70L95t2s/edit?usp=drive_link)

Some of my conclusions :

* A lot of groups are involved at least partially into the song production process.
* While 2nd Gen group where already involved in song production, it seems to be increasing in the 3rd and 4th gen.
* Idols are mostly involved in the lyrics writing  and sometimes in composing but very few group are involved in the arrangement in theirs songs.
* While it's common for groups to have songs with members being the only one writing the lyrics, when speaking about composing it's less common and even rare when speaking about arrangement.
* While some groups are involved in the process since debut like Stray Kids or Ateez, a lot of group grow more involved with time, it's the case for BTOB, GOT7 and 2PM.
* Another pattern is that some idols have a lot of credits but a more limited involvement in their group music like Zico (178 credits, implicated into 45% of Block B discography) or Ravi (238 credits, first idol in term of credits, implicated in 63% of VIXX discography).
* Within group most of the time you have 1 to 3 members highly involved and the other with a credits, sometimes only a few members are involved at all. There is only one group (with a generally high level of implication into song production) where all the members are equally involved : Xdinary Heroes.
* The most involved members are most of the time the main rappers and lead rapper of their groups for exemple Zico, RM and Hongjoong. An exception is for exemple Seventeen's Woozi (Lead Vocalist).
* Some companies seems to promote or prefer group involved in the song production process for exemple JYP, YG, FNC or CUBE and other companies seems to have group with little involvement like SM or BELIFT.

**Edit** : Like u/bananamilkandbanchan commented that the first credits stats was biaised because KOMCA was classing credits are arranged by numerical order (the older the registration the smaller the number,the higher on the list). They are right and my verification were biasied because I used my Stray Kids album to check and because of the high level of involvement of the band i didn't realise the order on KOMCA was wrong. I have decided to remove first credit from my stats. I could search them but I would need to check manually on the tracklist of each album (several hundred) and I simply don't have the time or strength to do so. 
I'm sorry for my mistake. ",107,51

kpopthoughts,1f0neyn,2024-08-25 05:41:29,ENHYPEN are being overworked like crazy and it seems it won't stop anytime soon,"I am a very new ENGENE (casually listening since May and ""stanning"" since July/Romance : Untold), so I obviously don't know everything about the group, but even in the short time of fully following them, it's apparent that they're severely overworked. And I say this as a stan of ZB1, who are also crazily overworked, but that's beside the point of this post  

Since their debut (late Nov 2020), about 3 years and 8 months ago, ENHYPEN have released 3 full albums (2 KR, 1 JP) + 1 repackage, 5 mini albums, 1 special album, and many digital singles/collabs/OSTs. They most likely have a repackage in the works for their most recent full length album, Romance : Untold, which was released in July. One article even mentioned the repackage coming out in September (see [here](https://x.com/namaewariki/status/1821530415137689678)), but the headline of that article was quickly changed, so it's unclear if that was a leak/spoiler or just a wrong information. Their previous repackage was released 3 months after the ""original"" album, so if they follow that same timeline, the repackage would be released around October  

Additionally, they started touring in Sept 2022, a little less than 2 years ago, starting with Manifesto (22 shows from Sept 2022 to Feb 2023), followed by Fate (21 shows from July 2023 to Feb 2024) and Fate+, which is supposedly an encore of Fate despite having the same number of shows (21 shows from Feb 2024 to Sept 2024)... The members have also mentioned a new tour (see [here](https://x.com/baekwoniee/status/1821058761374487008)) and while some fans thought they were referring to Fate+, it's apparent it's a completely new tour, especially since no songs from their recent album have been performed during Fate+  

It was announced yesterday that Jay would be missing yesterday's concert. It is the third notice about his health this year (sickness + knee injury + sickness) and it's clear other members are also unwell. Yesterday, Jake had difficulty keeping his eyes open while singing (see [here](https://x.com/ikeulubb/status/1827294288176140507)) and had to sit out two songs (see [here](https://x.com/jaeyundear/status/1827268405684269178)), leaving only five members performing, and a few days ago, Heeseung wasn't able to fully do some of the choreo (see [here](https://x.com/cuddlyhees/status/1825446973769412641)) and Sunghoon mentioned during a live that some members were developing colds (see [here](https://x.com/namaewariki/status/1826238009282633841)). I'm sure I'm missing more than this, but their conditions are clearly not good. I'm not sure if this is common, but they've also had absurd plane schedules, with frequent stops in Korea for a single day, before going to another country for a concert/event/fansign, etc. I am in no way blaming any of them, I 100% believe they are doing their best despite feeling overworked/tired/sick  

ENHYPEN are also very young, with most of the group having debuted as minors, so the ""threat"" of military service is still very far. Heeseung, the oldest member, is just 22, so it's not like there's a rush. They are a permanent group as well, so I would think that the long term would be a priority, but it doesn't seem like it... A lot of fans have been trending tags/sending emails, etc. recently and even more after yesterday's situations, but I have no idea if that's going to change anything  

I'm honestly wondering if/when BELIFT will give them just an ounce of rest. And yes, I am aware that like any other company, they are greedy and want money, but even then, does no one at there understand that this pace is not sustainable at all? With ILLIT doing very well, I thought BELIFT would switch their focus on them, but they haven't had their first comeback yet despite debuting 5 months ago. I'm just very concerned that something worse will happen to them...  

Are there any other ENGENEs that feel the same or fans of other groups that have the same concerns for their groups? As I said in the beginning of my post, I am also a ZEROSE and while I have similar concerns with them, I believe both situations are very different, mostly because ZB1 is a temporary group. It's unfortunately not surprising that WAKEONE overworks them the way they currently do. I believe TXT is in a somewhat similar position with the constant releases/tours, but I don't follow them closely enough to confidently say that",100,25
kpopthoughts,1ez92lk,2024-08-23 12:12:05,Why I love how chill ENHYPEN are as a group,"I'm a fan of Enhypen, and I just have to gush about them. No drama or arguments—just some fun talk.


**I love their growth.**

I love their journey as a group. They seem so sincere in their passion, which I really appreciate. In the beginning, they shared in a VLive that it was super awkward because everything was new to them. New house, new jobs, new team, new fans, new comeback. They started filming right after I-LAND ended, so they weren’t used to the cameras being in their face 24/7. They felt pressured to be entertaining and didn't know how to navigate the demanding environment.


At first, it seemed like every little scandal took a toll on them, and you could see it affecting their dynamic (especially the solos and shippers). But lately, it feels like they’ve grown closer and stopped letting the haters get to them. They look more comfortable now with themselves and each other.


**I love their chemistry.**


What I love about Enhypen is they don't try to be a group they're not. They’re not the type to be chaotic or be crazy affectionate with each other. They don’t do cheesy compliments, they rarely hold hands, and they're not flirty with one another. It's just not their love language as a group.


What they do instead can be seen in the ""little things"". It's the way they cook ramen for each other, shopping for one another, play games that a member wants (even if they're too tired), refuse to play pranks on one another when a PD asks them to, take each other to their hometowns, or sacrifice their jackets/hotpacks for each other. They barely even betray each other in games because they feel guilty (and are awful at lying).


They're a normal group of friends. They do try to be funny sometimes but they still remain true to themselves. If they’re not in the mood to play, they won’t force it. If they don’t want to prank/betray someone, they won't do it. If a member doesn't want to do something ""entertaining"" for a show, they respectfully opt out (including aegyo).


They’re not chaotic and trust me, I also stan chaotic boy groups (several!). But I love that their content is relaxing and funny without being overwhelming. It's not noisy or overstimulating and watching them brings this peaceful kind of happiness.


**Their music blew me away.**


Lastly, while I mostly talked about their personalities, it was their latest comeback, Romance Untold, that pulled me in. Their music is incredible, and their vocals are on point. Enhypen’s strength is definitely in their dancing, and they absolutely kill complex choreos. I also like that they support one another in their artistic experiments. Their music hooked me in first, but their personalities locked the door behind me. My personal favorites are XO, Moonstruck, Fever, Pass the Mic, Bills, and Polaroid Love.


Anyway, I just wanted to share my love for them as a new fan. Thanks for letting me gush!


Edit: I just watched Shootbro and another proof of them being the chillest group. They rarely fight but even if 2 members argue, the rest of the group would keep cool and just watch the argument happen from the sides lmao. They trust the members can de-escalate by themselves and never cross the line. They're also quick to apologize and don't hold grudges even back in I-LAND. They remind me of kind, old ahjummas for some reason lol.


Edit2: I just want to add, they also apologize if a prank fails because they didn't fall for it. Seriously, they're too honest and cute.",341,79
kpopthoughts,1f2o703,2024-08-27 20:21:27,Create a K-pop playlist with each song starting with a different letter,"I've always thought these games were interesting because it shows people's different tastes! Create a K-pop playlist with each song beginning with a different letter of the alphabet e.g. A is Abracadabra by Brown Eyed Girls, B is for Bae Bae by BIGBANG etc.



If you want to make it more difficult then try to only have one song per group or soloist. For example if you picked Abracadabra by Brown Eyed Girls or Solo by Jennie you can't pick any other song by Brown Eyed Girls or Jennie. If you want to pick a song by a group that the soloist appears in though, that's fine!

it can be anything from a specific nasty dorm story, to something they posted on social media, or did on stage etc.

i dont mind hearing about ANY boy group, but i do specifically like ateez, stray kids, bts, enhypen, txt, seventeen, p1harmony, xikers, the rose, and xdinary heroes, so if you have any stories about them like that then that'd be a bonus",189,180

kpopthoughts,1eppfby,2024-08-11 18:49:17,"B-side ""Brought the Heat Back"" from Enhypen is giving 80s?","Listen, I know I'm kinda late but I love ""Brought the Heat Back"" from Enhypen. I'm also a huge fan of Music from the 80s. In my opinion Enhypens song is giving a strong 80s vibe? Do you guys agree? I haven't seen anyone talking about it",66,10
kpopthoughts,1epu69l,2024-08-11 22:10:02,ENHYPEN's Romance : Untold was actually a great release that deserved more attention ,"With the R : U promotions ending, I just feel that it wasn't as appreciated as I expected it to be. 

I may be biased as an ENGENE, but I thought the boyfriend concept on them was refreshing. I agree with the general idea that the dark vampire vibe suits them best and they carry it in a unique way that nobody else can, but they pull off these concepts well too. They're pretty versatile. 

The most major upgrade I've felt between Orange Blood and R : U - vocals. They sing and sound so good and smoother than before. I think each song brought out their voices reallyyyy well.

The choreo as always slayed, and they mentioned Brought The Heat Back to be one of their hardest choreos while singing live I think. It has a diff dance for each chorus and so much jumping and moving around, yet they make it look effortless. 

The quality of music is great too, I personally liked each track a lot. I think generally people would like Moonstruck the besttt, so I recommend you to listen to it :)

I also put Belift to blame for not promoting RU efficiently. Imo, they should've done more variety shows and promotional content, instead of keeping the boys busy in travelling around for so many events at once.

Even if I try to think objectively, they're all pretty talented and strive to learn and improve, so I hope they get more of their deserved viral moments soon :D",181,72
kpopthoughts,1es6md3,2024-08-14 18:49:23,What’s a “scandal” or fanwar that makes you giggle every time you think of it?,"I’ll go first. I have two. 

The first is when Enhypen released “Bite Me” and Engenes got all upsetti-spaghetti about the boys having female backup dancers. Be so for real right now, why did it matter? Maybe I’m just delulu, but I thought the dancers (and the choreography) were hot. 

The other is from when Everglow released “Pirate” back in December of 2021 and Atinys got all uppity about Everglow “copying” Ateez’s “Pirate King.” Whatever they were smoking back then, I want some, because on what planet were those two songs similar? Different concepts, different groups, different keys, different videos, different choreographies. I wish I could have enough spare time to take that crap seriously. (Lucky for me, my friends who are Atinys laugh at that fight with me, and it’s like an inside joke between us.) ",417,326
kpopthoughts,1etocq4,2024-08-16 15:08:22,MVs that will make you say what the fuck but in a good way,"I LOOOOVE music videos that have weird, campy, dark comedy vibes, unserious but unsettling (yknow with body parts getting dismembered & shit) or anything full of symbolisms/hidden messages/weird imagery, A24 films level stuff, too many things going on that will make you scratch your head, or has a storyline that's disturbing or out of this world and requires multiple rewatches in order to fully grasp its meaning. So yeah those are my kind of MVs. 😆 

After the new LISA dropped I realized that there are so many of them released just this year in kpop (or kpop adjacent artists) maybe bc it's a trend now but I'm so here for it.

These are all I could think of on the top of my head which again I know are mostly recent releases & thats cause I dont know that many yet, as just a casual listener of a lot of kpop groups who have yet to watch every music video out there. So yeah, comment down mvs that you think fall under this description too.

PS. I know camp is a fairly common concept and styling in kpop but I'm talking about the editing & storyline of the video itself more than just the style & theme. There are about hundreds of kpop mvs where the group is just dancing or projecting & posing to the camera while wearing over the top clothes and hair & makeup with colorful & weird imagery & graphics in the background and I'm NOT talking about those

kpopthoughts,1eq7x6a,2024-08-12 09:56:08,songs i hope some kpop groups will cover,"**illit - songs with a dark/horror concept** 

i really hope they'll cover a song with a horror concept like red velvet's peek-a-boo. it fits their dreamy, magic kind of concept, and will suit the members since they did dark concepts a lot in runext.

**babymonster - like ooh-ahh (twice)**

i actually have a vision for this hahaha.. it's really different from their usual songs but this was the kind of concept i was hoping they would choose when i watched the last evaluation. a lot of the members suit a girly concept so they would really shine in this, and it also has a pretty fast-paced rap for ruka and asa. 

**enhypen - 70s retro concept**

i really, really want enhypen to try a retro concept- they did so well in 'come 2 me' and 'she was pretty'. their visuals also fit an old-school concept? idk lol",16,9
kpopthoughts,1emtp2r,2024-08-08 03:45:02,Hybe Has To Be The Most Frustrating Company When It Comes To Touring,"Yes, this post is inspired by Seventeen's tour announcement. Everytime a Hybe group announces a tour, I can't help but roll my eyes because I know that it's gonna be the same thing, Korea, Japan, America and the rest of Asia.From TXT, Enhypen and Seventeen every single Hybe tour skips over Europe, Latin America, Canada, Australia and Africa. If both New Jeans and Le Sserafim were to tour in 2025, guarantee their tours would go the same as the other groups. I just know that those groups all wanna tour those places, but it goes back to Hybe. It also doesn't make sense when other companies sends their idols on world tours. YG had BlackPink with the Born Pink tour, and they'll have another one with 2ne1, BabyMonster and Treasure all having tours next year. Stray Kids will be touring this year this with 2 stadium shows in Australia. Twice performed in Europe and played in stadiums in Melbourne and Mexico City. Ateez performed a stadium in Brazil. As someone who lives close to LA, I geniunely feel bad for people living in Canada, Europe, Latin America, Australia and Africa, who'll more than likely never get to see their favorite Hybe group live in concert",309,158
kpopthoughts,1ekzw4x,2024-08-05 23:34:53,Who are the Olympic athletes who are K-pop fans?,I don’t know if this has been addressed before but k-pop is a decently popular niche industry worldwide and I wonder if there have been fun little anecdotes about Olympians who are k-pop stans. If anyone knows anyone who is please sound off! Is there a swimmer who stans aespa? A runner who loves enhypen? A decathlon who is an army? A blink? Etc etc.,165,77
kpopthoughts,1el8nvl,2024-08-06 06:25:10,All the groups and artists that share the same song titles,"

With all the fuss, the backlash and even plagiarism accusations from some stans towards another artist for using a title and concept that's actually very generic, I got curious and wondered just how common it actually is for a title (mostly english ones) to be repeatedly used by multiple artists, just in South Korea alone. 


So I spent hours listing the most commonly used song titles I could think of and each artist that share them. (And honestly I don't know why I did bc it's not like I have nothing better to do, I actually have piles of work waiting to be done but I hyperfixated on this instead but that's beside the point lmao)


So yeah basically I just wanted to show how dumb it is to think that only one group or artist can own a song title. 



(I may have included K artists outside of pop & idol music in this list as well as other global idol groups marketed as kpop fyi)

I knew I still missed a lot, even from groups that I ult 😭 but thanks to everyone who are pointing them out in the comments!!!

kpopthoughts,1ekzi3u,2024-08-05 23:19:16,Which albums track list would you arrange differently? ,"Basically if you could change tracklist or transfer one song to another album which ones would you change up?

My picks:

1. IVE's 'Dear Cupid' as intro/bside for 'LOVE DIVE' but I think it's quite obvious, popular opinion

2. aespa's 'BAHAMA' as 'Better Things' bside with lyric video/self made mv to promote it 

3. I also think some bsides from Enhypen's 'ROMANCE:Untold' would fit 'Orange Blood' album better (for example: Your eyes only)

4. I'd remove 'Karma' from 'Dark Blood' album and replace it with 'Lucifer' from 'Memorabilia' album. 

5. I would put Red Velvet's 'Beg For Me' from 'The ReVe festival 2022 - Feel My Rhythm' album on 'The ReVe festival 2022 - Birthday' album.

Vernon would have been fantastic even if he was part of Le Sserafim or Aespa. If we just modify their songs a little bit for him, I see him doing cool concepts.

kpopthoughts,1ef51dm,2024-07-29 19:14:07,Idols Whose Voices Are Perfect For Western Pop Music? ,"**warning**: this is subjective! 

A lot of my favorite k-pop vocalists happen to be really suited to r&b (regardless of if they actually sing it or not lol), but there are some vocalists who I feel are really suited to that Western pop sound. Think of male singers who have been popular in the Westerns mainstream pop space (they all have pretty similar type of voices imo) or female singers who don't have an overly high or low tone.

Anyways, here are some idols who I believe would sound great singing Western pop music (unfortunately, it'll be mostly boy groups as I'm more familiar with them), in no particular order: 

* Jungkook of BTS ([duh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lYFD0sDFxZ8cr9ttczB7pH1zYc8r16kkg))
* Heeseung of Enhypen ([cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4PDo8W2FJQ))
* Jake of Enhypen ([cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD3gPMdFTts))
* Jacob of The Boyz ([cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bHJaL16lKs))
* Yunjin of LSR ([original ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF9qc-I7EeQ)song)
* Nayeon of Twice ([cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO9GiPOLd3I))
* Jeon Somi ([original ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOBjwlfIZdE)song) and etc. 

Interesting to note that at least half of the idols I chose either were born overseas or lived there, but it goes to show how ones singing style is formed by the influence around them. 

There are definitely a ton more that I'm not aware of or haven't been paying enough attention to, so feel free to shout out others down below! Let's all be kind :) ",84,219

Jay of Enhypen - I loved how he sang say you won't let go and ever since I wanted to hear more songs from him

Sunoo of Enhypen - I love it especially when he sings IU songs 

Jeongwoo of Treasure - I checked him out because he was the other main vocalist of Treasure and since I loved Yedam's voice I thought I might like his voice too and it was fascinating that I was correct that I will love his voice. I loved how he sang always in a show

kpopthoughts,1e1jkg2,2024-07-12 16:50:52,The ultimate guide to Enhypen's demon bed bouncing music,"I became a fan of ENHYPEN in February 2024 so I'm definitely biased, but I think ENHYPEN is one group that does, um, (I'm trying to be tactful here)... self-loving, offspring-manufacturing, bedroom calisthenics, bed-bouncing music, exceptionally well, but like a demon is in bed with you. It's music that makes you feel like the devil is courting you and that you will probably consider becoming undead for her (yes my personal devil is a beautiful haunting woman for the queers). **I'm talking strictly about the mood of the music, not the lyrics or concept (which typically veers philosophical and PG with copious amounts of angst).**

Even in their latest album that's a bit lighter and more laid-back, there's still some solid additions to that class of ENHYPEN music. SO, without further ado, here is the ultimate list of ENHYPEN's 'demon deep loving' music:

* [Moonstruck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN1hNIzGoWg)
* [Lucifer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMfxf0qxH80)
* [Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7d6Dt17yHk)
* [Chaconne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEMRUqox9qM)
* [Criminal Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fOMnO-oNSM)
* [Sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqK8kBU8_wU)
* [Blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsYWbL-IEc)

I think ENHYPEN's discography is genuinely so good partly because of the range of moods and vibes they do so well.  Few groups do 'sultry + vampy' music moods as well as they do, they don't even have to try hard it's like it comes naturally to them.

Nobody asked for this lol but I hope someone finds this list useful. Or at least, it's inspired some ideas for bedroom cardio sessions. Goodluck everyone and I hope you check out ENHYPEN's latest album!",127,20

kpopthoughts,1e899qb,2024-07-21 01:59:28,The Boyz 'Zeneration II' Concert & VIP1 Review,"Total Concert Rating - 8/10

* 11 stars for good setlist and cute beach set
* Minus 2 stars for promoter announcing ticketing two days before
* Minus 1 star for ridiculously high ticketmaster prices

Pros:

Even though the tour was called Zeneration II, there wasn't much overlap in the songs of the tours. The similarity was rather a departure from the super cute songs of their early career and towards a hard-hitting and sensual setlist.

Having so many dark songs in the setlist was probably a good choice for the international fans. Kevin mentioned that they replaced B.O.Y., their debut song from the Seoul stop, to Reveal for the U.S. stop. Kevin noticed how much we adore Reveal, and I found that so thoughtful.

Still, The Boyz had the middle third of the concert for their upbeat songs such as D.D.D., which The Boyz remembered they filmed in New York City. Except for Younghoon it seems, XD.

Cons:

When the lowest ticket price for Radio City Hall was announced at around $200, I worried the attendance would be poor. So, it seemed a decision from the DreamMaker promoter to slap on a Hi-Touch benefit to drive up sales, which wasn't a VIP benefit from the B-Zone world tour.

The Hi-Touch idea worked, because a few days before the concert I checked, and all the Hi-Touch Orchestra seats were essentially gone. Save for a few straggler Dynamic Pricing seats capping at approximaely $1k.

**Pre-Concert:**

The concert started a three minutes after 8p. Since we wanted the concert to run smoothly, we mostly entered our seats a good one hour before the show. It was a good idea we did, because bathroom lines were atrotious. Radio City Hall staff closed off the basement stairs with yellow tape, which I had never seen at any show before. Additionally, when we went to the tippy top fourth floor balcony with less crowded bathroom lines, staff yellow taped that place off too. Like what??

Which brings me to how Radio City Hall organization was really lacking. Signage for restrooms was really poor. Additionally, they made us check-in VIP holders starting at 3:30p. Ironically, because everyone panicked and arrived exactly at the same time, it just caused more long lines. Frequently VIP2 holders, which is only the photocards of the members benefit, kept getting sent in circles. Because the VIP2 line was so short in comparison for the VIP1 line.

Plus, they handed out the moost popular members photocards, like the Bermuda Line of Juyeon and Younghoon, to the people who came later. Overall, we kept crowding the Radio City Music Hall sidewalks the whole day, because check-in took so long.

Then, we even had the merch line spilling into the people were were simply entering the hall, from the outside. I had no way to move, like seriously. Overall I was dissapointed in how Radio City handled the whole thing. And it's not like they don't have a clue how kpop works either. Radio City had Enhypen's Manifesto concert two years ago.

Advice to those attending future DreamMaker concerts, with VIP: The individuals checking us in were actually super strict about the the ID thing, which never happened to me before. Like, usually my VIP benefit transfers regardless of whether I know the seller or not. But I'm still happy I checked in before the concert, because otherwise I'd have left the Hi-Touch much much later.

**Concert:**

The setlist was actually impeccable, considering The Boyz are a seven-year old group. They surpised me by having their Japanese songs like Breaking Dawn in the setlist. There was a good choice to start with hard-hitting songs, and end with hard-hitting songs. Only things I'd change to the setlist are as follows:

1. Replace Maverick with Roar or Lip Gloss. Maverick simply is their weakest title track. A more recent title would have benefitted the flow.
2. The four-song section was INSANE. You could tell how tired the Boyz were from performing ""Bite Back"" to ""Reveal"" to ""The Stealer"" to ""Watch It.""

At the very least, I thought there would be a talking section after the new song reveal, asking what we thought of it. I barely processed the glory that is ""the Stealer,"" before The Boyz launched into Watch It, yet another Hard-hitting choreo.

The crowd work they did was also pretty good. Kevin even helped a couple in the pit to propose. He said, ""Speaking of someone special, there is someone special in the crowd. No, it's not Beyonce.""

After Kevin helped propose, he said, ""This was my Taylor Swift moment."" Then, he called for an encore of Fantasize / Fire Eyes, to celebrate the moment.

* Speaking of Kevin, man he was cracking dad jokes the whole night. ""I never taught we'd perform Right Here, right here!"" Also Kevin blurted out, ""Did you guys know that New is actually named after New York?""
* Our youngest Eric got to end the show by being the first to bow, considering it was first time embarking on a U.S. tour. Kevin told the crowd to welcome him home.
* Main Vocalist Sangyeon was really giving his all trying to hit the high notes. I can't believe he will be enlisting within the year, it's speculated.
* Sunwoo gave us his good rap flow in the hard-hitting songs.
* Main Dancer Juyeon had fun dancing all the moves during Thrill Ride, which by the way is my favorite The Boyz song.
* Face of the Group Younghoon was having cute interactions with the others on stage.
* Jacob was really sweet during his talking moments, I wish he got more attention from people.

The adorable floaties on stage for the happy cute songs were great, one of the members had his feet stuck inside. In terms of the stage, the ultra wide stage of Radio City Hall really benefitted The Boyz. Because they are a group on the bigger side, the 11 member really looked impressive spread out wide on the big stage.

**After Concert:** Now, time for the VIP1 experience.

The Hi-Touch even happened pretty well in the beginning. We were waiting calmly in the auditorium, in our seats. I just didn't like that they had The Boyz standing to the side, instead of facing us. The room was really dimly lit too. When I do Hi-Touch with Leo Presents concerts, it's nice just seeing the group nicely lined up in a well-lit room, so close to you. Even before it's your turn to greet them.

* Eric likes fist-bumping more than palm-to-palm contact, so I got a fist bump from Eric.
* For the rest of the members, I had regular hi-touch hand contact. I remember touching hands with Jacob, he is so sweet.
* Then I got to Juyeon, my bias, and I literally melted. He made sure to give more interaction in the fleeting moment than necessary, by forming the hi-five so to speak, and making eye contact with me. Can I say I am shocked his hand is so big but also so soft? Like Idk why I expected a calloused hand from a Kpop main dancer, lol.

I totally get who Does listen to the previews and watches the teasers because I used to do that and it can definitely make you look forward to the cb more but I’d rather go into it completely blind once everything drops honestly… and obviously it’s also a marketing strategy too bc a song can already start going viral from the preview alone thanks to tiktok edits etc… but I feel like the teasers just give too much away like I don’t wanna know what the entire album is gonna sound like literal WEEKS before it drops and then overplay the video and end up already tired of the songs once they’re officially out / end up disappointed bc I thought the songs were gonna sound different LMAO DOES THIS EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE…

In conclusion, K-pop group names have always been strange, weird, silly, fun, and unique, with some names being wilder and more unique than others! It's not new to this generation's groups (4th/5th). I think it's time we embrace it. Did I miss any names you think are strange or unique? Let me know in the comments!",569,191
kpopthoughts,1dx0i3c,2024-07-06 23:46:26,Stats about Boy Groups album sales over the years,"HI everyone, I'm a new kpop stan (since December) and I like to understand things. For me stats are a great way to see the informations.

After seeing a lot of informations and debate about who is the biggest group, the most popular, ... I wanted to see what the number said.

Before my conclusions a few disclaimers : I don't know everything so some informations may be wrong, I don't read korean so I had to rely on a few english sites to get the numbers. Finally I only studied the 4/5 biggest groups per generation according to sales. I also haven add the 2024 sales because the year is not over yet (some groups haven't done a comeback yet). Also I only studied sales of korean album based on the Hanteo and Circle Charts mostly. 

Here are my sources : [https://kpopping.com/](https://kpopping.com/) and [https://genius.com/](https://genius.com/) and [https://koreansalestwt.blogspot.com/](https://koreansalestwt.blogspot.com/)

List of the groups in my stats :

* 1st Gen : Seo Taiji and Boys, H.O.T, Sechs Kies, Shinhwa and g.o.d
* 2nd Gen : BigBang, Shinee, TVXQ and Super Junior
* 3rd Gen : BTS, Seventeen, Monsta X, EXO, GOT7 and NCT/NCT 127/ NCT Dream
* 4th Gen : Stray Kids (SKZ), Ateez, The Boyz, TXT, Enhypen and Treasure 

Here's the link to the stats : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TZhk8Z8dqiKqnKI\_P29XoFDV4w2-U1K/edit?usp=drive\_link&ouid=114658307732402964046&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TZhk8Z8dqiKqnKI_P29XoFDV4w2-U1K/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=114658307732402964046&rtpof=true&sd=true)

And some of my conclusions :

* Top 3 biggest group according to sales number : BTS (44.7M), Seventeen (35.1M) SKZ (23.2M)
* Biggest group in each generation : 1st Gen Seo Taiji and Boys (8M) 2nd Gen TVXQ (12.3M) and Super Junior (6.2M), 3rd Gen BTS (44.7M) and Seventeen (35.1M), 4th Gen SKZ (23.2M) and TXT (14M)
* Top 3 best selling album (in the first month) : Seventeenth Heaven (Seventeen 5.3M), 5 Star (SKZ 5.2M) Map of the Soul : 7 (BTS 4.1M)
* Top 3 debut album sales : Enhypen (318k) NCT (230k) Treasure (218k)
* Quickest group to reach 500k album sales : Enhypen (5 month) Treasure (17 month) TXT (24 month) 
* Quickest group to reach 1M album sales : Enhypen (11 month) NCT (2.5 years) Treasure (3 years)
* Quickest group to have their 1st music show win : TXT (8 days) TVXQ (93 days) Shinee (116 days)
* Slowest group to have their 1st music show win : Shinhwa (1361 days / 3.6 years) Monsta X (915 days /2.5 years)  H.O.T (771 days / 2.1 years) BTS (691 days / 1.8 years) 
* Most productive group (number songs released divided by age of the group) : SKZ 28.1 songs per year, Monsta X 19.4 songs per year, Ateez and The Boyz 18.1 songs per year

In general 3rd and 4th generation groups outsales 2nd generation groups (none of 2nd gen groups ever sold 500k album). 4th generation groups have a quicker growth in general than previous generations. 1st generation doesn't work with this dynamics as some of the group sold multiples 1M albums. However as they were the 1st Kpop group they had very little competition. 

The groups on the list that have participated in Mnet Kingdom have all seen a rise of album sales after.

Being from a Big 4 Agency is not a assurance to a quick success : GOT7 and SKZ had a progressive growth. In the 4th generation there is successful groups that are from smaller agencies : Ateez (KQ), The Boyz (IST).

And of you have some question, leave a comment and i'll try to respond quickly.

Edit 1 : I know album sales are not a perfect indicator for popularity. It was just one I use to start because the data are easy to find and rather complete. I'll perhaps do another study on other factors : concert, awards,... If you have another indicator you think could work better I'll look into it.

Edit 2 : I corrected some small mistakes and reviewed where I found the number of songs per groups and how i counted them. It come from [https://kprofiles.com/](https://kprofiles.com/) and I decided to count only officially released song and only one time each (no matter the remixes and different languages version) and I still don't count solo songs not release within the groups official releases.

Edit 3 (Last one I promise) : I added 1st Generation groups and Treasure that I skipped over by error when studying 4th generation. The 1st generation group are not use in some of the comparaison as I didn't have enough details about the sales (only the total sales and at minimum 1st month sales). The total album sales can be misleading due to massive purchase of earlier albums following the group gain in popularity (a great exemple is BTS see the difference between 1st month sales and total sales on the first few albums). 

I think I'll publish the GG version in a week or two if anyone is interested. \^.\^",115,127
kpopthoughts,1dsi0w7,2024-07-01 04:21:33,Fatal Trouble by Enhypen is a straight ear-gasm. Top tier ,"Fatal Trohble is probably my top song released rhis year. The chorus just makes me ascend to a different plane of existence. The vocals go crazy. Ni-ki (my bias) was actually given some lines and I got to hear his deep voice which was amazing. Don’t get me started on the dance. Idk how their new album will top that song for me but if it does lord help the people around me.

 I am absolutely obsessed with the song and if you haven’t listened to it I highly recommend you do. ",13,1

ENHYPEN is a dance-based group, so I’m not surprised HYBE forced choreo into a song like Bills. However, I find the entire choreo so funny.

Then I discovered kpop and i've noticed that its not just me who used to be a limelight (wdw fandom name) and is now a kpop stan. But I think its crazy how the why dont we members are like 'following' us into kpop, like Jonah and Daniel from the group wrote Twice's english single I got you?? That is so crazy to me, And i remember Why dont we performing in Korea for a concert so were they really that popular back then? If anyone who wasnt a fan of Why Don't We but liked kpop in like 2019, did you guys know of why dont we? I know that their song 8 letters were popular, and that enhypen Jake had mentioned he used to sing their songs during evaluation. So were they also popular in Korea? ",13,11

I know it’s unrealistic to think I can win without buying a ton of albums, especially since Enha’s a popular group, but I really want to try. 

Has anyone won a fan call with any kpop groups in the past without spending a ton of money or hosting a group order? 

Also the sites currently hosting fan calls are Weverse, Yizhiyu, and shopee. Does any one of these sites give a better chance of winning compared to the other? ",6,13

Put them all in an escape room, have them solve a mystery or give life advice and watch the sheer snarkiness unfold.

Idols I’m thinking of are Shinee’s Key, NCT Dream’s Renjun, and Enhypen’s Sunoo (they are the fox idols I’m familiar with but I know there are more). What other idols would join and do you think it would be entertaining? I think shows grouping other representative emojis could be cute too.",33,16

Exactly like the title says, what are all the kpop songs that make you emotional because of the lyrics/message/story behind it or simply just the way the vocals, instrumentals and beat evoke so much emotion and sadness but also comforting in a way? I'd listen to them all and make a whole playlist because I like hurting myself through music for no reason 💀

kpopthoughts,1dsiv64,2024-07-01 05:07:09,Songs You Dislike Unless They Are Performed Live,"I have gone to 4 kpop concerts in the past year and something I realized is that songs that I wasn't the biggest fan of were more enjoyable live or with a crowd. For example, I am not the biggest fan of TXT's *Cat and Dog.* I get that it's campy and supposed to be just for fun, but personally I never listened to that song outside of the first listen and would skip it if it were to randomly show up in my recommended playlist. However, I throughly enjoyed listening to the song and singing along when I went to go see them earlier this month. I still don't have it on my playlist, because like I stated above, the song isn't for me, but I have a new found appreciation for it because I think it is a good song for concerts. Some other songs that fall under this category for me.

kpopthoughts,1dlzfla,2024-06-22 18:25:21,ENHYPEN's newest concept cinema might be a flashback that took place before ORANGE BLOOD,"So, ENHYPEN just released their [concept cinema/short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYOTtz-7js0) for their upcoming album, and oh my god it is EPIC! I saw that many ENGENEs are confused about the concept, notably how it relates to the previous comebacks and such. So here is my theory:

I think this concept cinema film might've took place between Dark and Orange Blood. Perhaps this a flashback. The [Kalpa concept images from Orange Blood](https://reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/17knmk9/enhypen_5th_mini_album_orange_blood_concept/) look similar to the memories/time the boys spend playing instruments ([2:51](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=171)-[3:50](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=230), and from [10:01](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=601) til the end of the film.)

The [Ksana concept images](https://reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/17j57gc/enhypen_5th_mini_album_orange_blood_concept/) depicts the boys with a car (similar to the one in the film); the fire sparks and lightning might depict the gun fight ([6:18](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=378)-[7:58](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=478)), and you can see the boys are all bruised and scarred in the images. 

At the beginning of the [Orange Blood concept trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqxMyWLZtwM), the boys are all washed to shore; this might take place after they all revive and continue to escape ([9:17](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=557)-[10:45](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=645)). 

Finally, from [Belift's official description of Orange Blood](https://beliftlab.com/artist/discography/ENHYPEN/7?lang=en): ""the boys, having once forgotten ‘you’ due to their ignorance, experience a profound awakening and pledge to sacrifice themselves for ‘you.’ Upon losing their power that once seemed eternal, the boys come to a profound awakening that nothing lasts forever ...  After proving their love through sacrifice and coming to terms with the finite and mortal nature of the world, the boys pledge to remain by your side even as poison courses through their veins (btw the poison might also have been shown in the cinema film: [6:09](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=369) and [6:15](https://youtu.be/eYOTtz-7js0?t=375))."" This kinda matches up with the album name of 'ROMANTIC : UNTOLD' and the phrase ""only if you say yes"". So this album's concept might be revealing the untold parts and stories of ENHYPEN's love towards ENGENEs.",58,2
kpopthoughts,1drbjqw,2024-06-29 15:45:54,KPOP songs that give off the same vibes to songs from artists you like outside of KPOP? ,"I know there were earlier discussion threads with a similar topic but with all the new music releases I think it's time for an update. (Cuz wow there's a lot of them lately). And this isn't just exclusive to western pop but any genre at all. I listen to a lot of alternative artists so they're mostly what make up my list.

(So I said same vibes instead of similar so if you find these sounding nothing alike, again I didn't mean to say that they're exactly the same. On some, it's just the instrumental, others have just some certain verses that kinda sound alike, certain vocal distortions, style, riff etc. Meanwhile some also could actually be sampled like I recently just learned about that Lisa track. )

kpopthoughts,1dped6z,2024-06-27 02:42:17,How do people manage to get barrier/floor seats + VIP for so many concerts? ,"Hi ~ 
I follow a number of kpop influencers on instagram and lurk on several others' profiles - by ""kpop influencer"" I mean non-kpop idols who have a lot of followers because they're really into a group or several groups, they post news updates, fangirl over members, etc. I won't name any but the ones that come to mind are some SKZ and TXT stans who kind of have their own mini ""fanbases"". 

I see in their highlights or posts that they're almost always pit and/or VIP for concerts, whether the group is their ult or not. This isn't about financial means, I'm not interested in how people make/spend their money. It's more of the logistics of it. From everywhere I've looked and different people I've talked to, getting good tickets for a decently popular group is basically a fight for your life and a game of chance all at once. And from personal experience of getting floor for TXT I know that the really close seats sell out IMMEDIATELY, so it all makes me wonder how people are able to get such good seats for so many different concerts. Are they just really lucky, or do they have followers with connections, or do they buy the tickets at resell value, ? Or is getting floor/pit seats and VIP passes not as difficult as I am thinking it is? 

If you're someone who is floor and/or VIP for a lot of concerts, how do you repeatedly snag those spots? What's the secret to getting really good seats for all these different groups? D: The one thing I can think of is that it might be easier to get those close seats if you're going to a show in a smaller venue, but the influencers I'm thinking of almost always go to shows in LA, NY, Chicago etc and somehow get floor and VIP for those too, so I'm really curious on how. For groups, I don't mean BTS-level of popularity but groups that are still quite popular/hard to get tickets for like SKZ, Twice, Enhypen, TXT, etc. ",42,52

kpopthoughts,1di21c6,2024-06-17 18:17:00,Once in a while I look back at my first ever post about Enhypen Sunghoon and just smile to myself because I didn't expect to like him as much as I do now,"Three years ago, before I was an Engene, [I posted about how I thought Sunghoon was such a beautiful prince](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/qshdes/enhypens_sunghoon_has_such_a_princely_aura_i_cant/). I hadn't intended to become a fan of any other Kpop groups at that point, but this was the time when he was getting a lot of hate for being a bit awkward during his MuBank MC days, and I got curious enough to check out some of his videos. I never watched I-Land (and still haven't, to be honest) and while I already had many of Enhypen's songs saved onto my playlists (impeccable discography btw), I didn't even know Sunghoon existed beyond the vague knowledge that one of the Enhypen members competed in figure skating.

I guess it was perfect timing, because a few months after that I went to Japan for my graduate studies, and because Enhypen had a lot of concerts there -- my failure of which to get into is well-documented in this very subreddit -- I was able to see firsthand how much Enhypen as a whole and Sunghoon in particular have grown as (a) performer(s). Even three years ago, when I was first getting into them, they had still not experienced performing in front of the audience due to pandemic restrictions, and when I went to their concert in Osaka it was in a massive dome with 20,000 or so attendees, in a country I was alien to, eight hours from where I lived at the time. My fondness for Sunghoon singlehandedly led me to drinking with strangers in the common area of a cheap Osaka hostel -- which, yes, is also well-documented in this very subreddit.

I flew to Taiwan to see them. It was the first time I ever flew to a country using my own money. I almost missed the beginning even, actually, because for some reason the bus that Google Maps said went straight to the venue ended its route like two kilometers away, and I only had fifteen minutes until the start of the concert to spare. It just so happened that there were two Japanese girls on the same bus going to the concert, and I managed to ask them, in extremely stilted Japanese, if I could also get into the taxi with them to the arena. Thank God. I almost started crying on the sidewalk honestly.

I don't know why it is, but apparently I keep getting into situations with Japanese people when it comes to Enhypen. Shoutout Japanese people, they've been nothing but kind to my stupid ass.

I went to their concert in New Clark City in the Philippines. I remember blanking out seeing Sunghoon so close from the cart they had that went around the venue, he's so beautiful it's actually hard to fathom. I remember my throat clenching when I saw clips of Sunghoon crying during their latest concert in Seoul. Have you guys seen his fancam of their Fatal Trouble performance? His dance lines are so beautiful, his eyes are so expressive. Did you know he trimmed his brows, yet they're still so thick and shapely? He posted a selfie recently that was so hi-def you could see where he shaved them off because they're growing a bit stubby. Did you know he likes to go vintage shopping? That he likes natto? That he seems to have very specific articles of clothing he re-wears a lot?

I have so much affection for him. I would get into any number of situations with Japanese people if that's what it takes to see him smile.

His smile is super cute, by the way. I have his picket propped against the wall beneath the TV (a more hallowed place than our family's Catholic altar) so that every guest that comes through our living room will be greeted by Sunghoon's gentle smile.

Anyway, what I want to say is -- even beyond album sales, Spotify stats, Melon charts, corporate measures of success, and the general competitiveness of the Kpop industry, I hope to see Sunghoon find fulfillment as an artist, an entertainer, or as a cafe owner that he seems to really be looking forward to in the future, like genuinely, because he's just like that, I guess.

Good luck on the comeback next month, Enhypen.",55,6
kpopthoughts,1dm1vuo,2024-06-22 20:16:46,"[Results] The K-Pop group popularity ranking, according to Reddit (or, ""How popular does Reddit perceive each K-Pop group to be?"") [2024 Version]","Hello everyone!

I'm here to present the results of [a poll I posted a couple of days ago asking Reddit to rate K-Pop groups according to how popular they perceive the groups to be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1dhg7q9/poll_how_popular_do_you_perceive_each_kpop_group/) For those unfamiliar with the survey, the survey had a couple of pointers:

* In this survey, respondents were asked to OBJECTIVELY rate how popular the following K-Pop groups are CURRENTLY. 

* Respondents were asked to factor in both domestic and international popularity, and to take multiple metrics into account (ex. album sales, domestic/international charting).

* This time, as a helper tool, [I created a spreadsheet of detailed popularity metrics/numbers for every group in the survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1150oZ4pJt-ZU_B20ROv3GtED3C1oAv7EpKPvjocMSTo/edit?usp=sharing) and attached it to the post/survey for respondents to use while rating groups. This way, respondents could more easily gain a holistic/statistical view of how groups compare in various popularity metrics.

------

**How the results are scored:**

Respondents were given 7 levels of popularity that they could assign a group to. I converted each level into a number:

* Top Tier --> 7

* Big --> 6

* Medium-Big --> 5

* Medium --> 4

* Small-Medium --> 3

* Small --> 2

* Nugu --> 1

I then took the average of the scores to obtain the ""popularity score"" for each group.

This year, I will be presenting both the ""Sorted"" Score and the ""Raw"" Score. The ""Sorted"" Score removes responses that had numerous outliers (ie. they gave ratings to groups that couldn't justifiably be given that rating when factoring in the various popularity metrics that are supposed to be taken into account). I have also included the ""Raw"" Score that includes these outlier responses as well though, for transparency.

--------

Let's start! First, we'll do the **Boy Groups Popularity Ranking:**

kpopthoughts,1djmck3,2024-06-19 17:44:06,I really wish companies would prioritize full length albums again over EP’s,"Especially when half of the songs are just remixes or an English version like what happened to creating full creative body’s of work that told a story had interconnected dots/storylines that involved a beginning middle and end?

Yes I know groups such as enhypen tend to have a “story book” theme in their albums with their intros/outros/interludes which is fine but I’m more talking about when people used to have at LEAST 10-12 good well thought out tracks on an album that weren’t randomly jumbled together 

Something that awakens your senses not just in the moment but leaves you so impacted that you have a hard time moving on from it.

All these singles dropping back to back with little to no substance is saddening. Yes the song may sound catchy and fun but I miss when people took their time to marinate the music instead of a temporary appeasement until the next single. 

I’m aware the current state of social media and appealing to a young crowd (especially a western audience) with short attention spans have a lot to do with it and it’s business at the end of the day and they have to look at analytics and hone it with what the majority wants but overall it’s sad",158,44

Hottest-Army-Engene-Zerose

2pm really got me hooked on Kpop (yes am older) and really wish they'll do a reunion tour as they are the only bgI haven't watched live yet. 

I was an early army coz of THE legendary weekly idol episode and honestly got off them a bit when they started with English songs, but still my ulti group by a long shot. 

4th Gen is the most debatable for me as they had so many good ones. I originally wanted to write Deobi but soon realise am more a Sunwoo fan and rather listen to his solo songs. Do give them a listen, they are very underrated. Also a sucker for survival shows which is why Enhypen has a sizable piece of my heart. Also saw them live this year and wow they are so talented and charismatic. Which brings me to being a rabid Boys Planet watcher and hence ZB!! they are coming to my country in Sept and hope am able to score tickets.

What's yours and hope you have a great day!",4,19
kpopthoughts,1daoip3,2024-06-08 01:06:32,"Enhypen's ""Memorabilia"": a review and analysis ","“Memorabilia” is Enhypen’s special album project associated with their group’s webtoon, Dark Moon. The mini album includes two previously released singles, “One in a Billion” and “Criminal Love,” and 4 new songs, including the first official subunit releases of the group. I think it would have been very easy to throw together a collection of filler songs into a quick album that could cynically be seen as a cash grab from fans of the webtoon and of the group. But then again, the same could be said for both “OiaB” and “Criminal Love,” the latter of which is, in my opinion, one of Enhypen’s best songs. If the full album was anything close to the quality of those songs, then I knew I would be more than satisfied. Since its release, I’ve been mulling over my thoughts and opinions on the album and have finally materialized them into a review and analysis that I wanted to share with other listeners. It's a bit long, so I've tried to organize it into sections to help guide the reader.

I. Introduction  
One of my favorite experiences as a fan of Enhypen is the first listen-through to a new album. I remember waking up at some early hour of the morning to listen to “Manifesto: Day 1” and laying in my bed with my covers over my face, just letting the music wash over me. I was on a bus to work when I popped my headphones in and clicked play on “Memorabilia”. For the full experience, I listened through the two previously released tracks, then heard the first few moments of melody and Heeseung crooning to open “Fatal Trouble,” and I was staring out of this window, living in a world of romance and melodrama as the streetlights passed me by. I think the first word that came to mind to describe the album was lush. It’s a feast of vocality and musical production, anchored by the yearning rock ballad title track “Fatal Trouble,” journeying through themes of fated and failed loves and the nihilism of immortality, and exploring different aspects of vampirism, which has been the group’s lore since their inception. The album is atmospheric; each song creates a distinct experience as you listen through it, while feeling cohesive and complete as a full track listing. 

My general approach to most albums, k-pop or otherwise, is to do a first listen-through start to finish, to get a sense of each song and how it fits into the narrative of the album as a whole. Then I listen to each song while reading the lyrics, followed by a third listen to focus on the instrumentals and music production. For k-pop albums in particular, I also like to incorporate the performance and choreography into my appreciation for a song, as they are designed to work together as a full package. More than once, my appreciation for a song has increased substantially based on the performance (the opposite is certainly true as well). Based purely on the album previews, I had a sense that “Lucifer” and the title track would be my favorites, but as I’ve had time to let the new releases mentally marinate, my favorite songs of of the bunch have come out to be “Fatal Trouble,” “Teeth,” and “Scream” (a surprise standout). 

II. The album's vocals  
If you listen through Enhypen’s albums in chronological order, you’ll notice that with each subsequent release, you can hear the singers’ voices more and more distinctly as they’ve moved away from the autotune chokehold that HYBE artists tend to work with, especially early in their careers. I won’t pretend that all the members were vocal powerhouses from the very beginning; Heeseung was definitely the most musically developed at their debut. But I feel very strongly that credit should be given where it is due; all seven members have substantially improved their singing abilities over the years and they sound very very good here (selfishly, I’ll also throw in that their previous official album release, “Orange Blood,” is also a very good showcase of their singing abilities). Something I noticed and appreciated a lot is that all of the members really have the opportunity to stretch out their voices on this album, aided by the fact that they have some subunit songs.

Heeseung, Jay, and Jake anchor the choruses of “Fatal Trouble,” infusing their voices with yearning and heartache as they sing about blurred memories of a lost love. Their voices are soaring and full-throated over shimmering guitar chords. Ni-ki also gets to showcase an impressive falsetto in the final post-chorus. “Lucifer” is another example of the group stretching a new and different vocal muscle, with the subunit of Sunghoon, Jay, and Jake winding their way around a sinuous, haunting beat and rich, dramatic bassline. The song is, in particular, a chance for Sunghoon to show off his voice in a way that some of the group’s more recent releases have not allowed for, alternating between a delicate falsetto and full-bodied lower register. It’s also a demonstration of the overall maturity of the group as a song with a distinctly seductive sound, with lyrics like “So pray for me/ And I'll burn for you.” 

As a final point of discussion regarding the album’s vocals, I also made a note listening to “Scream” that each member gets around 3-5 lines of singing at a time, which allows us as listeners to hear their voices more fully. When you have groups with 5 or 7, or sometimes 13, members, it’s not uncommon for songs featuring the entire group to allow one line, or sometimes even a few words, per member at a time. This isn’t so much a commentary on actual line distribution, but more so a note about the actual length of time each member gets to sing for. So it was a pleasant surprise to hear their voices so distinctly in each section. 

III. Lyrics and themes  
The lyricism of the album is also rich and poetic, with lines like “No one knows we got the best seats in this ghost town” in “Criminal Love” and “Lucifer, with the flames of rage devouring me/I've been robbed of you” in “Lucifer.” The writing evokes beautiful imagery (“But anxiety looms over me/Like a waning moon” in “Fatal Trouble”) and contains references to songs in their previous discography (“I'll cross the border and get back on track again” in “Scream,” referencing their Border album series, and “Ooh, ooh, it's no fun anymore, no more fever” in “Teeth”). There are recurrent themes of fate, both being trapped by it (“Fate I can’t defy though it might hurt/Trapped in this infinite circle/I’ll find you still, again and again” in “One in a Billion”) and defying it (“Scream cause we wanna go faster/If fate blocks me, I'll just lightly push it aside” in “Scream”).

Thematically, the album seems to traverse a similar path to their “Blood” series so far. “Dark Blood” was driven by fatalism; the protagonists were imprisoned by their immortality, cursed into a destiny as undying monsters. The first five tracks in “Memorabilia” explore similar motifs. In “Orange Blood,” the characters have been reborn as humans, and we see a renewed determination to seize the day, to savor every moment of both joy and sadness as mortals. The final track of the album, “Scream,” echoes this sentiment - to reject hiding in the dark, without fear, and to live “faster” and with joie de vivre. Interestingly, it leaves the story open to the final act of their “Blood” trilogy, and I’m very interested to see how the story is concluded. 

IV. Digging into ""Teeth"" and ""Criminal Love""  
Other than the title track, “Teeth” is my favorite new release on the album. It has a unique sound with a fast-paced, frenetic club beat. The addictively rhythmic post-chorus (“Let’s play together, you make me so thirsty/Feel the bite bеtween my jaw, so tasty”) is playful and flirtatious, with an ominous edge, calling to mind the way a predator might play with its prey as it’s stalking them, letting them believe that they’re part of the game all while coming in for the kill. There’s also a delicious slowed-down reverb bridge in the middle of the song. Listening to it makes me feel like I’m sinking into the slow-motion headrush of a dance floor in a nightclub, some senses blurred and others heightened, feeling the music pulsate through me with neon lights flickering all around. It’s a nice example of the way the songs on this album create a distinct atmosphere. 

“Teeth” is also a great parallel to one of my other favorite Enhypen songs, “Chaconne,” from the mini-album “Dark Blood,” because they are both explorations of nihilism, the belief that life is ultimately meaningless (for those interested, I wrote about ""Chaconne"" in another piece earlier this year). Any piece of fiction worth its salt that explores vampirism will dig into how these characters, untouched by age and time, struggle to find meaning in their existence, from Louis’s search for God in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles to Adam and Eve’s laconic centuries-long existence in Jim Jarmusch’s film Only Lovers Left Alive. “Teeth” and “Chaconne” are opposite sides of the same coin, both protagonists singing about the endless cycle of thirst that drives their reality. 

One can see a similar arrogance in the lyrics. “Teeth” opens with a boast by the singer promising “money, power, and fame” and claiming “the world is my chessboard.” In “Chaconne,” the protagonist gloats that “death doesn’t concern me.” But “Chaconne” is distinctly melancholy in tone, the protagonist lamenting their fate with lines like “I love everything beautiful/If this moment is a curse, it won't stop” and “This is my world in the dark.” Meanwhile, “Teeth” has a fiery edge to its attitude, like the protagonist is almost annoyed at how boring their life has become (“It's no fun anymore, no more fever/I'm sick of games that are too easy”). They invite you to “play together” and “dance all night long,” while knowing that when the bloodlust dies down and the party ends, the numbness will return (“I have no inspiration, feel nothing/The hotter it gets, the more I feel nothing”). The songs are excellent counterparts, navigating similar themes but avoiding repetition.

“Criminal Love” is a previously released song, but I haven’t really had the chance to wax poetic about it, so I’ll do so briefly. It is a quintessential classic k-pop boy group song, in all the best ways, reminiscent of EXO at their peak - dramatic, romantic, seamlessly weaving together singing and rap, with a killer bridge, and a powerful stage performance. Every member gets a great moment in the spotlight - Ni-Ki showcasing his sing-rapping and deep voice alongside Sunoo’s higher pitch in a cool duet segment, Sunghoon shining in the striking first chorus with powerful popping, Jungwon displaying the versatility of his unique vocals in a beautiful R&B bridge. The song is also layered over Heeseung’s sophisticated ad libs. “Criminal Love” was first released at the end of July 2023 and has racked up nearly 40 million streams on Spotify in less than a year, a substantial portion of which I would wager has come from non-Engenes who have enjoyed the 2nd-gen classic boy group vibe the song has to offer. 

V. The stage performance  
As previously mentioned, I do like to incorporate the stage performance and choreography of songs into my appreciation for them. “Fatal Trouble” was performed as a special stage on MCountdown on May 30th, 2024, with the choreography video being released soon after. As the song is quite vocally heavy, I think I expected the choreography to be simpler and less strenuous. What I got instead was a beautiful contemporary-inspired choreography, with the members gracefully leaping and gliding across the stage, interspersed with precise torso and arm motions and body isolations synced to the song’s sharp beats. The elegant routine was emphasized by the group’s onstage styling in flowing layers of various shades of gray.

The dance practice showcases the formations better than the stage performance, especially the dynamic ring the members form around Heeseung as he sings the final chorus, calling to mind the whirling arcs of the Dance of the Druids from “Outlander” in the way that they circle around him like a protective coven. It was a lovely revelation as a distinctly new direction compared to Enhypen’s previous work. It’s very gratifying as a fan to see the group explore new genres in their music and dance, and given the overall skill of the members as dancers and performers, it was no surprise how well they pulled it off. 

VI. Critiques of the album  
I’ll finish by listing some of my critiques of the album. For all its strengths, there’s always room for improvement. The main weakness of “Fatal Trouble” is the lack of a bridge, which is a criticism I can extend to many of Enhypen’s recent title tracks. The song clocks in at just under three minutes, which seems to be the target length to optimize streaming. A bridge would have really elevated the song by breaking up the repetitive structure of verse, pre-chorus, and chorus, introducing a new melody or tempo, and creating an emotional climax to an already poignant song. I can point to several songs in Enhypen’s discography that are significantly strengthened by their bridge, including their debut song “Given-Taken” and “Memorabilia’s” own “Criminal Love.” 

Some of the production is a little rough around the edges; for example, a few vocal moments in “Lucifer'' come off pitchy or overtoned. And despite an overall trend of less autotune in their music, there are still some moments where I have trouble telling who is actually singing because of the way their voices are flattened. Finally, I would really like more utilization of duets and harmonies in their music. There are many tonal differences in the voices of the members, some excelling in falsetto and higher pitches and others with rich lower registers. I would love to hear their voices play off each other more frequently. 

That brings my review of “Memorabilia” to an end. Overall, I think it’s a strong addition to an already outstanding discography. Enhypen is a group that consistently puts out very good music, and as a firm believer in the “music-first” approach to k-pop fandom, it’s incredibly easy to be an Engene. If you made it through this whole thing, thanks for reading, I hope you give the album a listen, and I would love to know your thoughts!",60,9
kpopthoughts,1dde67h,2024-06-11 15:30:24,How essential is it these days for K-Pop groups to have a fluent English speaker? ,"Looking at the 4th gen and 5th gen K-Pop groups, it's difficult to find one that does not have a fluent English speaker. Hence, I wonder if companies are strategically recruiting English speaking idols to debut in their groups to ensure easier schedules overseas (touring, success in the western market, collabs, interviews, etc.).

It's hard to think of recent groups that don't have an English speaker, I can't think of any.

For example, J-hope of BTS is a well known ace in kpop. Everyone views Enhypen’s Heeseung as an ace, or Jennie from Blackpink, etc. However I definitely think there are many aces in the industry that people look over. I’ll go first: Enhypen is my ult group, and I definitely think Jungwon is an ace. He has amazing vocals, is known for his visuals, is regarded as one of the best dancers in the group, has a great personality that everyone adores, etc. I suppose rapping is questionable only because Enhypen isn’t exactly a group that includes a lot of rap. 

I’m curious to see who you guys view as an underrated ace! ",297,472

kpopthoughts,1d4yelk,2024-05-31 17:31:24,Watching the Fatal Trouble performance made me realise the high level Enhypen have reached as a group,"Before I start talking about how much I love **Fatal Trouble**'s choreography and how it is one of the most beautiful I've seen in a while, I invite you to watch the [performance](https://youtu.be/RQEvHFti5p8?si=8PTX2-hrw_RQY4cK) at M countdown and the [dance practice](https://youtu.be/GwnvuL3QCdE?si=xZpujsMgfub9qnwm).

I can't tell you how many times I've watched Enhypen's performance of **Fatal Trouble**. I can't stop thinking about how poetic and well-crafted it is. Each movement perfectly reflects the heartbreaking, angst-filled lyrics that depict the chaotic uncertainty that a relationship can be.

Enhypen are performers who just keep getting better and better, and it's so beautiful to witness. The facial expressions, the fluidity of the movements - sometimes sharp to accentuate the story they're telling us, the floor movements, the creation of shapes to represent the different phases of the moon, the synergy - I felt like I was watching a painting in motion.

But, apart from the beauty of the choreography (and the song), I think Enhypen made it even more beautiful by their group cohesion. After watching each of the fancams I was impressed to see that everyone, without exception, is a very good performer: some are very good at dancing, others are very good at facial expressions, which become the perfect blend of a good cohesive performance while they maintain their own stage identity. It's remarkable that they're at this level, because they've only got 3 years‘ experience under their belts, but they've got the technique of a band who've been on stage for years, and that's why I'm so excited to see where they'll be in a few years because they are such a complete group already.

I'm also thrilled to see that choreographers can be so creative with Enhypen, especially since Dark Blood. I've always loved their choreography and constantly had the impression of being invited to a scenic ball full of choreography that is both diverse, bewitching and mysterious - a world of their own that they manage to depict in each of their movements and vocals the more they grow as artists.

I can't wait to see what they come up with for their July comeback!",150,17

i truly love a good album intro and wanted to show some appreciation for them. some of my favorites include:

the intro ""#"" from the ""#"" album by loona (obsessed with how it flows into so what. also i think they used the intro for the mv or comeback trailer, so whenever i listen to this it brings the visuals of rhat era right back)

end of the forest from the fairyforest: temptation album by pixy (discovered this one today, so its the reason for this post lmao; a lot going on in this one but it is just soo moody and magical)

and i ofc have to mention my intro kings enhypen, my favorites of theirs are:

walk the line from border: day one (dont really love how it doesnt flow into given-taken and has  a very different vibe from it, buuut it sets up their concept so well and just sounds so good. its also one of the few album intros i listen to without listening to the album. additionally it takes me right back to enhypens debut days, so its so nostalgic for me)

fate from the dark blood album (THE album intro🤌. this is my most listened to track from the album. it is criminal how fate is not a full length song😭)

what are ur faves?",54,66

As a casual listener, I’m not completely sure what’s considered normal or borderline weird, I guess (I’m trying to refrain from using “delusional”).

That being said, TXT is currently on tour (I just went to one of their concerts!!) and I’ve been seeing a lot of videos and posts of other MOAs at their concerts. I’ve noticed that a lot of these MOAs (usually those with big tiktok accounts) got to their concerts more than once. Not in a way where they go both days (which I don’t get that much) or go to another concert that’s near, but those who fly from one side of the country to the other (ex. LA -> NYC). Don’t get me wrong, I really love TXT. I would love to watch them perform all the time, but these are MOAs who are buying VIP tickets each time (I think it’s about $500) and seeing them at the send offs more than once. They take pride over the group members remembering them, which I’m trying not to say in a negative way. (Side note: it’s really embarrassing seeing what some are saying to them at the send offs D: ).

Now, don't get me wrong—I understand the excitement and dedication fans have for their favorite groups.

Again, I’m not that familiar with the “norms” of K-pop other than buying their albums, listening to their songs, and going to concerts. Is it normal for fans to follow them around the country? Other MOAs often say they see the same people at these concerts/barricade. I guess this is familiar to fan calls, where the same people always win. 

This is also a bit off topic but when I’m scrolling on TikTok and I see a MOA post that they bumped into TXT in public, I like it and move on. However, when I actually go on their page, I realize that they bump into them a little too much…is this not weird? 

This relates to fans of other K-pop groups going to the airport that a group is in and mobbing them, which is really sad. Word spreads around fast about where these K-pop groups are and it feels a bit normalized. Recently, I think a boy group (I want to say ENHYPEN, but I’m not sure) was at a mall (?) and fans found out and were lined up at the place. I don’t think it was a public event. Again, it seems weird.

My thoughts were kind of all over the place, but does this ring true for other groups and fans? Do fans often travel across the country to follow their favorite groups for multiple concerts and outings? When does it become weird that they often bump into them in public?

**I’m also aware that this can all be chalked up to “They are supporting their favorite group” “You sound jealous” “Broke” “People can do whatever they want”---but I’m being seriously genuine.**

TL;DR: Currently, I've noticed many MOAs, especially those on TikTok, attending multiple TXT concerts across the country, even buying VIP tickets each time. While I understand their dedication, as a casual listener, it seems excessive to me. Is this level of commitment normal in K-pop fandom? I've also observed fans frequently bumping into TXT in public, which feels a bit strange to me. Does this behavior extend to other K-pop groups, and when does it cross the line from dedication to obsession? Just genuinely curious about fandom norms and behaviors.

**EDIT: Thank you all for your responses! You all have a lot fair points that it's normal to go to multiple concerts, even outside of K-Pop. I guess what I was trying to say that from my POV, the ones who had been posting a lot of going to their different concerts were also the ones ""bumping"" into them outside of concerts! It also makes me wonder how they get so lucky with their seating each venue. And like I said, I know it's not any of my business but I was just curious :3**",63,36
kpopthoughts,1d65pq8,2024-06-02 07:01:27,What are some really wholesome interactions of k-pop idols?,"I find senior idols interacting with their juniors super cute because they are always so caring and protective towards them.

Like when TWS said that Scoups bought all the members iPad iirc. And Seventeen members just being fans of TWS. When Seventeen went to Riize's room to do their challenge not letting the members know. It's cute.

Also BTS promoting TXT constantly and the little interactions they had while TXT went to view their concert and came to meet them backstage.

Also, TXT and Enhypen. Not much junior senior with them but they are always so cute because they are friends.

And lastly, when Sungchan, in his NCT days was finding difficulty to adjust, Taeyong helped him so much. One moment I remember is him recording Sungchan's part to give him reference.",116,72
kpopthoughts,1d4xke8,2024-05-31 16:55:03,Fatal Trouble Sunoo... save me Fatal Trouble Sunoo,"I consistently praised Sunoo's stage presence and his performance on yesterday's Fatal Trouble performance? Just absolutely stellar. I love how he easily stands out with his blond hair and he used that advantage to the max. Confidence in his dance is off the roof, his embodiment of sensuality is perfection, and his eyes... god his eyes give me life. Like I better not see anyone doubt him as a performer in Enhypen again, I don't care if he's literally the only feminine performer in that group he absolutely slayed in doing it and you know it.",32,5
kpopthoughts,1d4vvjx,2024-05-31 15:40:04,What are your favourite dance practice videos? ,"Okay so I just saw Enhypen's Fatal Trouble dance practice and it's been so long since I felt the way it made me feel. First of all the song had already blown me away then I saw the choreography and I was like how the fuck did they manage to sooo accurately depict the message through the dance, I had goosebumps all over. It's this satisfaction of hitting just every right note with the concept and doing just what needs to be done, nothing more nothing less.  Then I recalled the similar times when I felt this and immediately, I thought of TXT's Cat and Dog like it hits exactly the same. ",63,66
kpopthoughts,1d1ysny,2024-05-27 20:48:05,Korean Idols Who Don't Have Korean Citizenship?,"Basically, every baby who has at least one Korean-citizenship holding parent also gets Korean Citizenship at birth (for ex. a baby born in the US can also have Korean citizenship if one or both of their parents are Korean). If that baby is a male then that baby has until they're 18 years old (by March) to decide if they're keeping one or the other citizenship-if they don't do it at 18 then they have to wait until they turn 38.

For an idol, that would be the difference of them going to the military versus them working as a foreigner in Korea (to put it simply). Since there are a few Korean idols who are born overseas/have foreign citizenship I was wondering has any of them spoken on if they've renounced one of their citizenships?

Mark and Johnny from NCT, Bangchan and Felix from SKZ, Kevin, Jacob and Eric from The Boyz, Peniel from BTOB, Jay and Jake from Enhypen, Keeho from P1Harmony and I'm sure many other idols would have by now had to have made the decision to pick one citizenship over the other. I'm super curious if any idol has spoken on this at all, as someone who has dual citizenship herself lol.",101,97
kpopthoughts,1cu0kqq,2024-05-17 10:56:23,I lowkey really wanna see Enhypen's Sunoo as a villain,"Yeah it's weird on how I want a sunshine boy with no evil bone inside of him to be a villain but hear me out on this one.

Has anyone ever noticed his eyes? Just the way it is shaped it allows him to exude cute and friendly persona and the next thing you know his aura suddenly changes into alluring and deadly.

Like I just noticed his gaze especially on concepts that requires sensuality he excelled so hard in that area. Just the way he invites you in with his eyes, gazing to you like you are his own prey... god imagine how good he is if he plays a villain.

I want to see him sitting on top of a throne, with six men ready to be his strongest bodyguards and obeys all of his command. He would play an evil queen so well, with his persona changing from friendly to deadly within a second as he lets his bodyguards slaughter your army and singling you out to face him face to face. The way he commands everyone so well and turns deadly within a second... I want that kind of Sunoo.",75,18

For me I'd say it's either Bon Bon Chocolat (Everglow) or Lucifer (Enhypen). Personally these two songs give me somewhat dark and dreamy vibes and I feel like people can relate to it in different ways, I'd love to have such reactions if I was a song 😭 (sounds so silly each time I say it). Let me know yours!!",17,22
kpopthoughts,1crl5al,2024-05-14 08:05:13,Enhypen's Lucifer and Still Monster connected? ,"I want to start this post by saying, I can't articulate my thoughts well, and I may be slightly biased in my opinion regarding the song [Still Monster](https://youtu.be/JsYvBibzY30?si=a04vVnnHj-Yz-HgR) from Enhypen's Orange Blood album because I love it so much but, call me crazy, doesn't it seem like it could be connected to the song [Lucifer](https://youtu.be/SMfxf0qxH80?si=mzP4DJo1zv5Z_K7E) in the Dark Moon Memorabilia special album? 

The lyrics for [Still Monster](https://x.com/enhypenupdates/status/1725402778212659371?s=46) and [Lucifer](https://x.com/enhypenupdates/status/1789983266247680157?s=46) go so well together that when I read the lyrics for Lucifer, I instantly thought of [Still Monster](https://youtu.be/nQLaPUZQuIQ?si=FuxhKcb-bfq3Bkrp),and how they connected- as if, [Still Monster](https://youtu.be/7tgA1OPrCco?si=uDA853cqzVzkJy-l), was the start or somewhere in beginning of their story and [Lucifer](https://youtu.be/SMfxf0qxH80?si=oBDSCXpeSm0UMLR7) was the end...or something along those lines.

Lyrics I was thinking of: 

[Still Monster](https://x.com/enhypenupdates/status/1725402778212659371?s=46):
To me who is full of scars, you are my sole savior. You are the only one who taught me the way to see myself. When you were by my side, I can be myself, I'm not a monster [...] I'm scared. All the nights without you, I will clearly become ruined, won't I? i'm anxious, I hold your hand again. I want you to hold me tight.

[Lucifer](https://x.com/enhypenupdates/status/1789983266247680157?s=46):
With Lucifer's blazing fire of anger, I swallow it up. I who was taken away from you becomes a terrible monster, I wreck and trample everything, all[...] the world that abandoned us becomes ash, just let it burn, though I burned everything with my fingertips, I can't get you back. 

I know Enhypen's lore and themes all connect basically, and the webtoon is important to their lore, but any discussions or thoughts about both of these songs would be appreciated because they fit so well and I am obsessed with both of them. I suppose this is an appreciation post disguised as a thought post... the yearning, the angst, the lyrics, ""i'll burn for you""... obsessed. Thoughts?

kpopthoughts,1cqw4ku,2024-05-13 12:38:07,Enhypen just released their best album and it's just a Webtoon OST album ,"1.5 hours ago Enhypen released an album, [Memorabilia](https://open.spotify.com/album/0OhJwEzXbK9Km6GQSPdmPU?si=f28HkZeDQquym2x3fuN68w&utm_source=copy-link) for their webtoon, Dark Moon, with Fatal Trouble as the title track. 

After having looped the album continuously since it's dropped, I can confidently claim it's my favourite Enhypen album. Each track is title track worthy, and honestly, though I LOVE Fatal Trouble, it's sad and beautiful and angsty, but it's the least interesting track musically. 

Enhypen went the experimental route this time, both with vocals and production. Case in point - Teeth. That song is a trip. And don't be fooled by how subdued and subtle it is, Lucifer too has a melody that goes to the most unexpected places. 

The already released Criminal Love is classic 2nd gen reminiscent Kpop, nothing experimental, but it's so undeniably well done that it emerged as Engene's favourite 2023 track at r/Enhypen! 

For pop rock lovers, One in a Billion (released 2 years ago with a pretty decent mostly animated MV) and Scream are your tracks. Though I do love OIAB especially the percussion in the bridge, the growth, especially vocally, since then is obvious in the other tracks. Scream is the only song with a slightly brighter sound and with it's summery groovy chorus, it's the perfect song to end this mini with. 

Highly urge any of y'all casual fans to check out [Memorabilia](https://open.spotify.com/album/0OhJwEzXbK9Km6GQSPdmPU?si=f28HkZeDQquym2x3fuN68w&utm_source=copy-link)! ",281,66
kpopthoughts,1cutg75,2024-05-18 11:26:04,Which K-pop songs have Intros that outshine the Chorus?,"K-pop's global success can often be attributed to its catchy pre-choruses and choruses, which resonate with most international fans even if they don't understand the lyrics. However, some K-pop songs feature intros that are particularly striking and memorable, sometimes even more so than the choruses. Just wondering which K-pop songs you think have intros that outshine the chorus? I'll start.  
1. 2NE1 ""I AM THE BEST"" - no explanation needed.  
2. SNSD ""The Boys"" - no explanation needed.

3. BTS ""Go Go"" - this song is my introduction to BTS and I still remember hearing the intro for the first time and  man, it still hits hard!

4. Jessi ""Cold Blooded"" 

5. IVE ""Royal"" - IVE is known for their absolute banger choruses, but this is the one song where I prefer the intro verse over the chorus. It gives me that nostalgic OG K-pop vibe that I can't quite explain.

6. (G)I-DLE ""Uh Oh"" - not necessarily outshine the chorus but the intro is simply iconic for it not to be mentioned.

7. EXO ""Tempo"" - EXO being EXO. No explanation needed.

8. Enhypen ""Bite Me"" - Enhypen's vocals were highlighted here!

7. ILLIT ""Magnetic"" - idk man, Minju's voice in the intro verse outshines the entire song. Her tone and the way she sang it just sounds incredible.

Let me know if I missed anything.

kpopthoughts,1cxz2sg,2024-05-22 14:30:53,"HYBE now owns 90% of Pledis, so why are people so hell bent on believing it’s independent? ","I originally made a comment under a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop_uncensored/s/OBLtEhvQIE) talking about the Fromis situation in the Uncensored sub, where op was asking “why people keep blaming HYBE and not Pledis when each label runs independently.” But I figured it was best to just make an entire post myself to gain more traction, so I can dispel some misconceptions regarding Pledis’s independence from HYBE, and even the Fromis situation.


Keep in mind that I am not trying to, nor am I intentionally trying to defend Pledis. If anything I am part of the group of people who believe BOTH Pledis & HYBE are at fault when it comes to the mistreatment (and borderline neglect) of Fromis. HOWEVER, I do ultimately lean more towards pointing my finger at HYBE for two main reasons; 1) Because HYBE are the parent company who originally owned 85%, but now 90% of Pledis, and 2) As the parent company (& majority owner of Pledis) they ultimately hold the power to make changes & decisions within Pledis, and they also have the final say in the decisions being made in Pledis. So in other words, if HYBE wanted to promote and give Fromis comebacks, provide better treatment for them, and pay them, they very well could, and it would very well be within their power and rights to do so. 

J-Carats just discovered that [HYBE now owns 90% of Pledis as of April 2024.](https://x.com/_k_t_y_s_h_d_/status/1792529549026328644?s=46&t=yTcL7CYOfiJIfJZ77fJQMQ). HYBE went from owning 85% to now 90% of Pledis, and yet people still want to believe they are Independent, and that the only thing HYBE provides their sub labels are resources and money. But why?… why do these people believe this? Isn’t it because it’s supposedly what HYBE said? Because so far all anyone has to say when asked why they believe these labels run independently, is that it’s because “that’s what HYBE said.” But yet there have been so many instances proving the complete opposite, especially when it comes to Pledis. 

Instances such as…

• As soon as HYBE acquired Pledis the release time and day of SEVENTEEN’s popular variety show ‘Going Seventeen’ had to be changed. Went from being released at 10pm on Mondays to 9pm on Wednesdays so it would align with the other HYBE groups variety shows who have their variety shows released on other days of the week at 9pm. 


• ⁠They switched SEVENTEEN’s Japanese distributors from LAWSON Japan (a very good promoter & distributor), to HYBE Japan. Which had also resulted in SEVENTEEN having to abandon their Japanese YouTube channel (which has over 1m subscribers), because HYBE wants ALL mvs (including the Japanese ones) to be posted on the HYBE channel instead. The YT channel is still there, but it hasn’t been active for over 2 years now. 

• They disbanded Nu’est, and whether HYBE stans want to admit it or not Nu’est disbanding was definitely HYBE’s decision. Pledis had EVERY chance to disband Nu’est (especially back in their earlier years pre-produce 101), but they never did. The mere fact that there is solid evidence showing Pledis was preparing to celebrate the group’s 10th yr anniversary and not a disbandment is another indicator that the choice to have Nu’est disband was HYBE’s. Even during the filming/shooting of their so called disbandment album ‘Needle & Bubble’ you can hear the members throughout the video referring to the album as their anniversary album and “an album to commemorate their 10th year,” not a disbandment album. You can even tell just by how the members speak of the album and even their career as a group after disbanding that they were completely blindsided and caught off guard.  Even the mere fact that one of the members (Aron) literally said they “were not given the choice in the matter,”  also heavily implies that only some of the members (Minhyun and Baekho) got the offer to re-sign with the company while the others did not. 

• Because Pledis became a subsidiary (aka a  sub label) of HYBE they had to shut down ‘SuperStar Pledis’ because it was a direct competitor to HYBE’s own music game app Rhythm Hive, and “interesting enough” Fromis’s music has yet to be included in Rhythm Hive despite SEVENTEEN’s music already being there. It’s been over 3 years mind you.

• ⁠Bang PD literally inserting himself into SEVENTEEN’s music during RTL era as a producer. As well as him also being present during TWS’s evaluation for their debut. You can literally see him with HSS watching over TWS giving his approval for their debut in their prologue video. If these labels are independent (especially Pledis), why is Bang PD there? Especially when he isn’t even the CEO of HYBE anymore? 

• HYBE literally being the reason SEVENTEEN could no longer perform on Music Core (MBC’s music show). Anyone who knows SEVENTEEN knows that they are basically MBC’s children. MBC has continuously showed their fondness & support towards SEVENTEEN since their debut (for instance, they gave SVT their very first music show win, & their very first reality show). But because of the HYBE & MBC’s feud every group affiliated with HYBE (even the acquired ones) could no longer perform on Music Core or even appear on certain shows related to MBC (such as ISAC). It wasn’t until I believe last year that HYBE & MBC finally squashed their beef, and literally as soon has that happened MBC literally congratulated SEVENTEEN on their return. It doesn’t matter what their feud was, if these sub-labels were truly independent from their parent company, then whatever feud HYBE had with MBC should not have affected the artists of these labels, much less the ones that were acquired. 

• Stripping the group’s official colors (Rose Quartz & Serenity) from the Caratbong ver3. This one is very obviously HYBE’s decision given the way the other lightsticks from the other HYBE groups are mostly black as well. SEVENTEEN themselves (esp Scoups) actually talked about how they had given ideas for what they wanted the ver3 lightstick to look like, but according to Coups NONE of it was actually incorporated into the lightstick. As much as Carats HATE Pledis (me included), Carats know for a fact that Pledis always did listen to and incorporate SVT’s ideas, and they definitely would not have ever thought to remove their representative colors (Rose Quartz & Serenity) from their lightsticks.

• They literally replaced the original Pledis CEO (& founder) Han Sung-Soo (HSS) with a former BigHit Vice President (VP) named Lee Dahye. Now apparently HSS is rumoured to be an In-House Director in Pledis and no longer the CEO, and he hasn’t been since 2022. They also removed the former Pledis VP Kim Yeon-Soo (KYS) and transferred him to HYBE Labels Japan (the sub label of HYBE Japan that houses &TEAM) to become the General Manager. So literally the original people in power at Pledis are no longer there and haven’t been since 2022. HSS was heavily involved in producing Fromis music (even some of Izone’s music), and he is probably the reason why Fromis ended up being taken in by Pledis when their former company Off The Record (OTR) seized to exist. While KYS is basically dubbed the father of SEVENTEEN. He is someone Carats very much like & appreciate. So it’s pretty interesting that HSS was switched out for a former BIGHIT employee, while KYS was transferred to another HYBE label, in which anyone can tell that was clearly HYBE’s doing.


Those are just some of the instances proving just how much HYBE clearly gets involved with Pledis (especially SEVENTEEN). Even to the point of making decisions & changes such as replacing CEOs and transferring VPs. So idk why people think because HYBE said these labels will remain independent that it means they will actually follow through with what they said. Aren’t we smart enough to not believe everything a corporation tells us and says, much less one that runs on money and has shown greed for it. Just because they say the labels will run independently does not mean that it will actually happen. And as far as I myself have seen, they have not shown us any reason to believe these labels are as independent as we are meant to believe, especially when it comes to Pledis.


As of April 30th 2024 HYBE now owns a whooping 90% of Pledis (they originally owned 85%), which is more than how much they own of ADOR (80%), Source Music (80%) and KOZ (66%). In other words, SEVENTEEN, Fromis, & TWS are technically more of a HYBE group than Le Sserafim, NewJeans, and BND. And if CJ E&M hadn’t given their entire shares to HYBE last year (in which HYBE originally only owned roughly around 48% of BELIFT), they would have also been more of a HYBE group than Enhypen & ILLIT.  Let’s also take into consideration that the original Pledis CEO (and founder) HSS never had more than 10% shares of Pledis since the HYBE acquisition. He went from having supposedly 50% to now 10% after the acquisition. Which is less shares compared to MHJ for ADOR (18%) and Zico for KOZ (33%). Which alone tells us that Pledis isn’t as independent compared to the others, nor does the founder HSS have as much power over Pledis compared to Zico (the founder of KOZ) and MHJ (founder of ADOR). 

Furthermore, I am not sure a lot of people are aware of this, but during the acquisition process (when Hybe was trying to acquire Pledis) there was actually a 3rd party involved (SONY Music), and that 3rd party is actually the reason HYBE was able to gain majority shares over Pledis. Before HYBE acquired Pledis the shares over Pledis was split between SONY Music and HSS. Interesting enough back in 2019 when CJ E&M wanted to acquire Pledis, SONY had originally wanted to sell their shares to CJ E&M, however HYBE (who was originally known as BigHit at the time) inserted themselves, and that’s when speculation & claims of Pledis possibly being acquired by HYBE started circulating around, with Pledis initially denying the claims. But then Pledis & SONY ended up rejecting CJ E&M, and in 2020 decided to accept HYBE instead.  HYBE was able to gain 50% combined shares from SONY & HSS in May of 2020, but then SONY decided to give HYBE an additional 35% a month later (in June) resulting in HYBE gaining a whooping 85% shares of Pledis, while HSS was left with 10% and SONY with 5%. So for those who want to say that Pledis (or the CEO of Pledis) “willingly gave HYBE ownership,” no they did not, it was SONY.  Some people have speculated that HSS may have been cornered by SONY into giving up most of his shares (resulting in HYBE having the majority) given SONY, CJ E&M, HYBE’s relationships with one another. And now K-Carats have now discovered that HYBE had gained an additional 5% shares of Pledis back in April, bringing their total shares up to 90%. With it being speculated that it might have been SONY who gave their remaining 5% to HYBE. Anyways, it’s VERY interesting that the current Pledis CEO is specifically a former BIGHIT employee. 


Another reason why I am more inclined to place blame on HYBE along with Pledis (but more so HYBE) is because of the way they seem to actively ignore or somewhat neglect Fromis. HYBE themselves barely acknowledge Fromis. We rarely see HYBE include or mention Fromis especially when highlighting groups from HYBE (for an example, during RUN NEXT when HYBE was listing out HYBE groups they mentioned nearly every HYBE group even Seventeen, but not Fromis). Even with their game app ‘Rhythm Hive’ Fromis music is not included and it has been nearly 3 years since Fromis has been part of HYBE, and yet BND is already included into the game.  Furthermore, another person made a good point in highlighting the fact that Fromis “are constantly excluded or briefly highlighted in HYBE shareholders' reports. That even when it comes to the general HYBE communication or projects, Fromis is either excluded or just briefly higlighted,”

Besides, it’s standard practice for companies to give regular accounting reports on their investments, and if something fishy was truly going on in Pledis with regard to Fromis, then HYBE as a parent company (and majority shareholder) has a responsibility to deal with it, not to mention they would have most definitely known about it. Like I stated in my post, if HYBE wanted to give Fromis regular comebacks and make sure they were being treated fairly (since they claim they don’t discriminate between their artists) then they would’ve.


[EDIT] - Why do people think I am blaming HYBE for everything wrong with Pledis? I am not, I am simply trying to prove that HYBE does indeed interfere with things related to Pledis (especially Seventeen). That they don’t just give resources & fundings like people (esp HYBE stans) love to state. I blame BOTH Pledis & HYBE for Fromis’s mistreatment and neglect. But I find it ridiculous that some people do not think HYBE shares any blame even when knowing that they are the parent company who owns majority (90%) of Pledis. 


Furthermore more, most of what I listed down has nothing to do with day-to-day decision makings. Replacing and reinstating a new Pledis ceo IS NOT some day-to-day decision making and it’s certainly not a decision HYBE would’ve had no involvement with or even responsibility for. Especially when the new Pledis ceo is literally someone directly from BigHit. SEVENTEEN’s contract with LAWSON Entertainment Japan being dropped in favour for HYBE JAPAN is also not some day-to-day decision making. That’s years of a relationship built between Pledis/SVT & Lawson that had to end because HYBE simply wanted to keep most of the money between themselves. The MBC situation is also not some day-to-day decision. That was a long standing beef that impacted and affected even groups acquired by HYBE. 

The way I see it, it feels like people do not really understand what kind of actual day-to-day and minor decisions are. Things such deciding what concept or an image their artists will take on (whether for a debut or a comeback), external brands their artists will work with, shows their artists will appear on, what content/merch their artists can put out and release, etc…those are day-to-day decisions that sub labels can and do make. That even though HYBE oversees them still , they however, do not need to share their input or interfere unless it’s something that can affect the overall company (aka HYBE) in a negative way.

kpopthoughts,1cviqee,2024-05-19 09:26:30,"""win the battle lose the war"" moments in kpop survival shows","Have been thinking of this, but there are missions in survival shows that end up not mattering all that much considering the outcome of the show, the edit other contestants get, and all of that, so I wondered about times when a group lost but in the end, got more benefit from the mission.

My example would be Chamber Five team in I-Land S1, where they were divided into cool concept (Flame On) and cute concept (Chamber Five). Sunoo chose Heeseung, Jungwon, Jake and Taki for Chamber Five, while K, Ni-ki, Hanbin, Sunghoon, Daniel, and Jay were on Flame On.

In the midst of practices, there were eliminations, when Taki sadly was eliminated because of votes. This meant that C5 had 4 members while FO had 6, so they had to pass one member to the other team, and Sunoo chose Sunghoon for his work ethic and talent. 

The contestants (minus Sunoo, Taki, Hanbin) were better at cool, badass concepts, so the cute concept was a struggle, and in the end Flame On won because of the better exectution and the clear confidence in the concept.

Still, I believe that they lost the war because in the end, the producers eliminated Hanbin that round (which is a whole convo) and Chamber Five ended up being the better liked song, that showed this new side of some contestants while also getting more entertaining footage of the teammates bonding. The most memorable part of Flame On was Ni-ki getting his moment to shine, but in general, the C5 team was more interesting because of the struggle and bonding.

Which I think was a push towards settling what the final line up would look like, mostly on the producers' side of things. 

Chamber Five lost the mission but that team is 5/7 of Enhypen right now, so I think they won the war and benefitted more overall in the end. 

I think about this pivotal event constantly, so what are other moments that feel like this in survival shows?",66,18

kpopthoughts,1cqqo51,2024-05-13 06:24:18,What are your thoughts on being a fan of idols that are younger than you?,"I’ll start by stating my own opinion. To preface, I’m a 2004-liner and I’ve been a K-Pop fan since 2016. Because of this, I’ve always assumed idols to be older than me. What first changed this assumption was the debut of Itzy back in 2019. Yuna, the youngest member, is only one year older than me. She’s still older than me but the age gap have definitely decreased. I don’t know why but this made me felt kind of old even though I wasn’t even an adult back then. Whatever the case, I was still sure that it will take years until idols of my age or younger would debut.

Then Niki was like, “Let me introduce myself.” As someone who watched I-LAND weekly when it was airing, it was wild watching Niki and Daniel pursuing their dreams while I was laying in bed rooting for them. Even Jungwon, who I just now realized is exactly 5 months older than me, was accomplishing more than what I could ever dreamed of doing. It was impressive seeing them in I-LAND and especially for Niki and Jungwon for managing to debut. However, I don’t know if this is even applicable to me, but I sort of had a midlife crisis. I’m honored that I was able to witnessed the journey of Niki, Jungwon and the other members debuting in Enhypen, but it also made me think to myself, “Wow, I need to get my life together.” (Spoilers: I still haven’t.)

Anyway, back on topic. Am I a fan of Niki, Jungwon and Enhypen as a whole? Absolutely. Although my bias is Heeseung, I like talent and both Niki and Jungwon are overflowing with talent. However, even with the debut of Niki, I was still sure that he was an anomaly, an outlier if you will. Yeah, he’s not. I’m not going to list out every idol that has debuted these past four years who is younger than me because not only there are many, but my self esteem can’t take it man. 

My ego aside, returning to the main question, is it alright for fans to like idols that are younger than them? My answer is yes. I understand where people who think otherwise are coming from, but I believe that ultimately you’re a fan of an idol because of their qualities as an artist. For example, I like Niki because he’s a dancing machine and I find his deep voice to be very calming. I like Jungwon because of his voice as well. I don’t how to describe it but his voice is very soothing and smooth, almost as if he’s reading poetry whenever he sings. His voice exudes an aura of grace, I like it a lot. I don’t think there’s anything bad if you’re a fan of them because of their skills. I mean, isn’t that what being a fan is all about?

Now, regarding whether it’s alright for fans to like idols that are younger than them because of their looks. I think it’s completely fine as long as you’re not weird about it. Using myself as an example again, I think Haerin is pretty cute. Her hairstyle and sense of fashion was what first caught my attention (pun intended) when I discovered NewJeans. I also really like her personality because to me, she’s the definition of chill. Her being an introvert is also very  relatable since I am also an introvert. These are one of the many reasons why she became my bias. However, ultimately, I like Haerin not only because of looks, her personality, or her skills in singing and dancing, but because she’s an artist. I am a fan of the artist Haerin. There’s nothing more to it. As long as you recognize and respect the boundaries of being a fan, I believe it is fine.

Thank you for those of you who made it this far. I never really thought about this topic that deeply until recently when one of my friends brought it up. I’ve also seen a couple of people voiced their opinions online so I thought it would be interesting to hear the thoughts of others.",6,10
kpopthoughts,1cl1cmy,2024-05-05 23:00:21,Am I the only one surprised to realise that Myung Jaehyun (BND) is older than Yang Jungwon (Enhypen)?,"Granted, the difference is like three months but I was _so_ sure Jungwon was like 21 or something. I’ve been Enhypen’s casual fan since their debut and funnily enough, I started stanning after I was already stanning BND – so all the gen dynamics are already mixed up in my head but it's still so baffling to realise how young Jungwon really was at debut and how young he was when he became the leader. Jaehyun’s the leader, too, and they’re both my biases (lol) but I can’t explain it, I’m just still slightly shocked that Jungwon’s the younger one of the two. 😭",122,23
kpopthoughts,1co2ioc,2024-05-09 19:16:13,"Kpop songs with a released official english version that's actually really good?
","Ok so someone started a thread for western collabs that are actually good and I was going to comment mine til I realized it was going to be a really long list from BTS alone lol so nvm and then this came to mind

I'm curious to know if some people are also pleasantly surprised with certain english versions of kpop songs. Most of the time, I find them to sound so forced and cringey but there are ones that just work so well or I dare say, might even be better than the original korean release. From their perfect pronunciation and grammar to their flawless rhyme while still retaining the song's meaning and poetry

The ones I personally enjoy and appreciate a little more than their original are the english ver. of the ff:

1. Sweet Venom - Enhypen
2. Like Crazy - Jimin
3. Zombie - DAY6
4. HWAA - (G)I-DLE
5. Highway To Heaven - NCT 127
6. Eve, Psyche & The Bluebeard's Wife - Le Sserafim
7. Lullaby - GOT7
8. Bad Boy - Red Velvet
9. I Can't Stop Me - Twice (the rap parts are kinda meh but the chorus is so good and hits differently)

kpopthoughts,1cfoi8b,2024-04-29 04:50:37,Why Do Hybe Groups Skip Europe When Touring,"One thing that I've noticed is that whenever a Hybe groups announces a tour,they never tour Europe. All 3 of TXT tours including this new tour didn't have any European dates, both of Enhypen's tours don't have any dates and neither did Seventeen's last tour. The last Hybe group to tour Europe was BTS back in 2019. It's also noticeable when other groups such as Twice, Itzy, Black Pink & Ateez have all toured Europe. It makes me sad for European fans who constantly have to miss out on seeing their favorite Hbye group in concert",155,122
kpopthoughts,1cfwl2f,2024-04-29 13:19:47,Are send-offs the new hi touch? Is it better?,"It seems like send-off is the new hi-touch, since that seems to be the primary offering for most VIP packages I've seen for bigger/more popular groups (examples being Enhypen, TXT, Blackpink, IVE, ATEEZ if the rumors are to be believed) to justify the higher price tags. But is it actually worth it? 

Aside from the occasional clip from people able to get to the front/barricade, it seems like chaos. If you're not at the very front, it looks to be valueless, since you likely won't get any interactions cause of all the people in front of you or even get a good look at them. Desperation kicks in, fans will likely mob and assault their way to the front as much as they possibly can. In some cases, people leave before the show's ending proper just so they can queue early. I've even heard of signed items being stolen? It just seems completely unorganized and the current format purposefully generates unruly behavior for those exorbitant prices.

You've got the same people who possibly attend every stop as well, so that doesn't help anyone either. (Not trying to condemn them for spending their money as they wish, it just seems like the same people get the opportunities that someone who hasn't been in that position will be able to) As cool as some of the clips are, it just seems to be a total waste if you're not up front. At least with hi-touches everyone gets to actually see and interact with the group, even if it's for a brief second. Not even the physical contact is need, even a hi-wave will suffice, in my opinion. 

Thoughts? Any other options or alternatives?",12,14
kpopthoughts,1ceuyid,2024-04-28 03:48:37,Who in your opinion has one of the sexiest voices in kpop (talking or singing),"for me

- skz - han (when he hits those high notes so effortlessly and his talking voice can be alluring as well 

- Yoongi - his talking voice can get really deep and sometimes when he’s performing he growls and it’s so sexy to me

- Jackson - his voice singing and talking is so sexy and smooth

- Dpr Ian - his aussie accent is so attractive and rich 

- Rain - his smooth rnb register is so mature and regal when he sings especially slower songs 

- Monsta X I.M - his deep voice is so attractive

There’s soooo many more but those are a few I wanted to point out

kpopthoughts,1cbfhqt,2024-04-23 22:47:48,Serian Heu - Visual Director of ILLIT; background and an invitation to discuss,"I was curious about Serian Heu ([IG](https://www.instagram.com/xerianheu/)) as she is visual director at HYBE and for ILLIT, including the Magnetic and Lucky Girl Syndrome MVs, and ENHYPHEN.  She was also former digital director of Vogue Korea and fashion editor at ELLE Korea.   
  
During her stint at Vogue Korea, she worked with [Jennie from Blackpink](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLd0KIsnYdr/?utm_source=ig_embed); [Irene from Red Velvet](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0fTrQ6EWGAWzTD67AqqBEJUBj17cTC8Nr7uFrWf5Tv6xiZf1MTXQ7cP17R7vNFmrSl&id=243736508983720); [Wonyoung from IVE](https://pf.kakao.com/_uxkxeWC/81110350); [Hwasa from MAMAMOO](https://twitter.com/MaisonValentino/status/1356514070363578369); [Jeon Somi](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAxRQVUB3D2/?hl=en&img_index=1); G-Dragon; members of TXT, Enhyphen, iKON, NCT, and EXO; actor Park Bo-gum; actress Kim Go-eun; actress Jeon Do-yeon; model Hyunji Shin; and others.  It would seem that her fashion bona fides are well-established.  To provide insight into the mind of Serian Heu (since she hasn't really given many interviews and there is not much written about her), I have provided some excerpts from the book ""Make Break Remix: The Rise of K-Style"" (released in 2022).  I encourage you to pick it up if you are interested in the subject.  
  
Quoting Serian Heu:  
“*On her style and influences*  
  
I change every season, and I am influenced by designers, musicians and people I shoot photos for. The actress Jeon Do-yeon impressed me when we shot her wearing Off White for Vogue. I found it cool for a forty-eight-year-old actress not to be afraid of trying something radically new.  
  
I like many different styles. I style my look depending on my daily mood. I enjoy clothes by emerging designers, including Koreans.  Colour and pattern grab my attention. I like mixing high and street fashion. I enjoy a lovely princess look with a baseball cap.”  
  
Again quoting Serian Heu:  
“*On interactions between subculture and mainstream fashion*  
  
Anything cool starts in subculture first and moves to mass culture.  Subculture looks down on mass culture and instantly discontinues something when it is picked up in the mainstream. Kanghyuk and Hyein Seo rejected offers to be interviewed for Vogue as notable Korean brands. They didn't want to be overexposed in mass media and become too popular.   
  
An intriguing contrast exists between mainstream and subculture fashion scenes. My high-flying New York fashion friend arrived in Seoul full of confidence a few years ago. She still asks me how she can break into the mainstream fashion circle. People with power constantly judge you and are wary of newcomers. While subculture crowds are very tightly bonded, they are still more open. They pay attention when someone new shows a distinctive sensibility or character.  
  
When I met hip people in subculture while working at Vogue, I felt embarrassed and small to reveal my job, so I just said I worked in publishing. I don't really belong to high fashion. I enjoy subculture more.”  
  
With this additional background on her, I thought it would be fun to have a discussion about her style philosophy and what she has brought to the table for Hybe and ILLIT.  
  
To address the elephant in the room: I wasn't going to get into the whole MHJ thing, but I think it is unavoidable and I feel like I should address it briefly given how unhinged things have become.  Serian Heu's visual direction in ""Magnetic"" and ""Lucky Girl Syndrome"" is anything but a copy of MHJ.  In the latter for example, one can tell that the styling is specific and deliberate: 90s era grunge, plaids, and casual beach wear with a nod to Aeropostale/American Eagle type 90s teen fashion plus lucky number 7, and even an homage to the Clueless skirt.  Even as someone outside of fashion, I could see this.  The fact that Heu and MHJ came to similar (but still rather different) conclusions about what is ""on trend"" is well short of MHJ's plagiarism claims.  
  
As a fan/stan of multiple groups (SNSD, Red Velvet, f(x), NewJeans) with which MHJ had/has been associated (but not an MHJ fan in particular), and as a fan of ILLIT, I have to say I am very disappointed in MHJ for her straw man argument / deflection and throwing both NewJeans and ILLIT under the bus.  I had given MHJ the benefit of the doubt when she left SM that maybe a lot of problems around her were due to dysfunction at SM (a whole other topic entirely).  At this juncture though, I have the following theory: MHJ left SM for Hybe seeking more artistic/creative independence; over time, she probably started to crave not just autonomy, but full independence, and perhaps felt somewhat threatened by the hiring of Heu, maybe not in that order.  When she saw the success of ENHYPEN and then ILLIT, that was the straw that broke the camel's back.  If Hybe’s audit confirms what has been alleged, I think she will find that she has no leg to stand on.  I hope for the very best for NewJeans and ILLIT after all this.  
  
tl;dr: Serian Heu is Visual Director at Hybe, works with ILLIT and ENHYPHEN, and has an interesting style philosophy which is inspired by subcultures and I speculate may have led to a cross-sublabel clash with MHJ.",345,24

kpop_uncensored,1lgoabb,2025-06-21 06:47:44,"Songs under 3 mins that still feel like a ""complete track""","I was listening to Bad Desire today and I never realized it was only 2 mins and 21 seconds long which surprised because one of my heartaches with the last 2-3 Enhypen tracks is that they felt just a tad bid short. I still enjoy it through and through bec I really like Enhypen's soundscape.

And I realized why it didn't feel as short — it has a ""faux"" bridge after the second chorus. So the way it's written is that it still has the elements of a longer song crammed under 3 mins.

Another example I can think of is Stray Kids' God's Menu — 2:47 long but the combination of its unapologetically loud sonic appeal and the writing of the Felix' faux bridge before the final chorus drop makes it feel like a complete song. While yes, God's Menu is longer bec it has longer verses (+ a post chorus in the first chorus) but them being able to cram all those elements in under 3 mins is impressive songwriting

So, anyone else got examples of songs under 3 mins that still give you a full song experience

It’s been 6 years since big hit last group so I want to see what they have to offer.

While the hands up stage is good overall, facial expression wise and making cool faces (the girl in denim-on-denim ate btw), the group as a whole just felt… a bit low energy? Like that dance break around 3:05 had all the setup to be super impactful: backup dancers, beat drop, etc but the moves felt so minimal that it didn’t land as hard as it could’ve I was like do more, give more.

Another example is [aespa's spicy](https://youtu.be/T0XInumvMjM?si=NqJGbQRPwI25wnnV) studio choom performance. Still a cool stage, but it felt like the moves weren’t really being *finished* or sold all the way. Idk how to describe it other than it feeling a bit lifeless sometimes, like they’re just going through the motions?

To be clear, this isn’t me saying “Katseye is better than everyone else.” I know their fans can get wild with the “K-pop idols wish” stuff, and that’s not what I’m on. I still enjoy the other stages and I know idols deal with super packed schedules, live vocals, etc. But Katseye also sings live and somehow still brings this sharpness and energy that just makes the performance *feel* alive.

Maybe it’s just a difference in style or maybe doing 2\~3 weeks of strenuous repetitive music shows get boring after a while. IVE at lallapalooza, TXT, Enhypen at coachella those stages were incredible. So I don’t think it’s a genre thing.

Anyway, if you know groups or stages that have that same kind of “oomph” or make you feel something, drop them. I love watching performances and want more of that spark.",2,11

I mean, I remember the good/euphoria feeling I had, but I barely remember their faces or much of the actual performance.

Eg I saw Enhypen at Coachella Week 2, second row at the barricade, and the whole time I was just like 😨 My bias is Jake. And you know how was Jake week2….and I just remember the feeling of “omg this is unbelievable.” But I don’t remember his face much, it feels more like it was a dream.

Does anyone else experience this kind of concert blackout?

Edit: I’m not saying that I am sad about it, about money spent etc. It’s more just a funny observation. Also, gpt says it’s normal, I’m just curious if anyone else had the same thing.

kpop_uncensored,1l3rhgc,2025-06-05 07:41:45,Opinion on bad desire?,"I honestly can't describe how Bad Desire is just so Enhypen.

From the concept to the sound, it screams their style. I keep saying this with every new release, but there's something in their music that makes it unmistakably them. Maybe it's the subtle (ok maybe its not subtle at all 😭) vampire references? I don’t know exactly what it is, but it’s there.

When I first listened to it, I was a little confused. The song itself is insanely good, no doubt about that, but the MV was overwhelming. There was so much going on that I didn’t know where to focus. You seriously need to watch it at least three times just to begin unpacking it.

You've got a demon whispering into your right ear, they’re falling from hell into heaven (even though we’ve all been taught heaven is up and hell is down), ash floating around them constantly like they run and there's ash they appear with ash they fight and there's ash . Sunoo just levitating like who took over his body bro 😭

This mv threw me off in the best way. Based on the concept photos, I thought we were heading into Enhypen’s sensual era, but instead we got this crazy journey from hell to heaven and back again. It’s not what I expected at all.

The only thing I’m still not fully sold on is the camera movement it felt a bit too chaotic at times but honestly, this MV might be the best thing I’ve seen all year. Every detail is packed with symbolism, and I’m still trying to process it all.

  
edit : I just watched the MV again and noticed that some members are going to hell and the others are going into heaven so I guess the term is like dragged instead of falling. BRO THERES SO MCUH GOING ON 😭😭😭",83,39

Among them I find Heeseung to be my most special and loved.

Hope everyone look forward to each and one of them but look beyond him (heeseung) I can say he's really charming, charismatic, soft-spoken, awkward. Beyond that, he carries a sense of quiet authority, ethereal-yet-grounded, mysterious, hidden world of emotional depth energy within him. Oh! talent is already given.

And I know it's impossible for pop songs to not sound like each other because, after all, the genre is called 'popular' music for a reason. I personally find it fun to dig for songs that sound like each other just to pass time. When I first heard *Loose* I genuinely loved it so much. It was the same feeling I got when I listened to *Sour Grapes* by Le Sserafim for first time. It's just such a fresh and catchy song. But I also knew immediately that it sounded like another song I used to listen to on repeat a long time ago and I just couldn't put my finger on it. It was gnawing at me 😭

kpop_uncensored,1ki3bsj,2025-05-09 00:36:58,"IVE's ""Accendio"" and Enhypen's ""Fever""","Context: I made a post talking about what songs pair well or sound like they're responding to each other. This is one of the pairs I wanted to do an analysis on the most since the lyrics sound like a call and response.

IVE's ""Accendio"" is an alluring song that depicts power, seduction, and control.

""cold as ice, but affectionate, gonna make you crazy""
The narrator in this song is playing hot and cold to drive their love interest crazy.

""when your calm heart sees me, yeah I like that it might stop""

IVE talks about making a normally calm romantic interest flustered.

""watch me, don't touch me, love me, don't hurt me"", ""cast a spell accendio""

She wants him to care for her without actually engaging with him. Accendio is a spell to set something on fire.

""accendio with your fingertips""

So the narrator is saying she's afraid the love interest will burn her if he gets to close. But earlier in the song when they talk about casting the spell, it seems like the fire begins with her casting it.

""pupils dyed with colors never seen before . . . that gaze is love""

The love interest has fallen in love with her, something she hasn't seen from him.

In Enhypen's ""Fever"" they are overcome with their obsession and longing for someone they can't reach.

""Those icy eyes, those red eyes, breaking me in two they shake me""

This line can directly parallel the lyrics in ""Accendio"". In accendio, she refers to herself as cold but affectionate, and how that will drive him crazy. In this song, Enhypen discusses being shaken up by her cold gaze. Both narrators in each song talk about the other person's eyes being an unusual color.

""When I stand in front of you who's sitting on the throne, the fire blazes up in me""

When the narrator gets close to the love interest who's in control, his feelings arise.

""I can't touch you, never"", ""I want you the more it hurts""

In ""Accendio"" she doesn't want to be touched, in fear that the fire she created in him will hurt her. In ""Fever"" he can't touch her because of the flame his feelings evoke, even if it hurts him.

""my body burns because of you . . . like a fever"", ""even when it becomes ashes, I want to spark again"", ""please let me go, please hug me"" ""like a fever, I want to suffer from you""

The narrator is burning up from not being able to get to his love interest because of the fire she ignites in him. He's willing to get burned to have her. He wants her to stop from evoking these feelings, but he also wants her to continue because there's still a part of him that will miss the flame that she creates.

In both ""Accendio"" and ""Fever"" they explore temptation through fire.
When you strip down the symbolism Accendio tells the story of a woman who knows her power and chooses to play with fire, but refuses to let it burn her. She encourages romantic feelings, but won't get caught up in them for her own safety. The woman is the one in control, but still fears getting burned. So she allows him to watch, but not engage. In Fever, the narrator is consumed by his passion and yearning for the person who stokes that fire within him. He actually chooses to endure the fever that the fire created but refuses to go after her anyway. In both songs they are scared of their feelings and choose to push the other away, but they still refuse to completely let go.

Both are great songs that are two sides of the same coin. They explore the magnetic, painful, and dangerous nature of desire and obsession. When paired together they tell a compelling narrative.",31,6

kpop_uncensored,1kg9uou,2025-05-06 19:08:15,"Enhypen's ""Given-Taken"" and Le Sserafim's ""The Great Mermaid""","I made a post talking about how certain songs in kpop feel like a response to each other and could play off of each other. I thought it would be fun to do an in-depth analysis for some of them.

Enhypen's ""Given-Taken"" talks about success in an introspective way. 

""Between giving and taking, it's time for my proving""
""In a shower of fate's arrows, I face the horizon inside me""

Whether it was given to them or taken from them through all of the trials and tribulations they have faced. 

""Countless moons I was wandering in the woods of questions""
""thousands of doubts behind me""
""The light burned me, the light covered my eyes""
""I followed the light in the dark""

They want to transform and evolve but there's a type of anxiousness behind it. A fear of the unknown. They still choose that path anyways, despite getting burned, despite not knowing where it will take them.



Le Sserafim's ""The Great Mermaid"" talks about success in a rebellious manner. How unlike ""the little mermaid"" they won't silence themselves to achieve their success. 

""It's all me, I don't wanna sacrifice""
""I'm living my life, I will get all that I want""

They don't want to give up their voice for love or change who they are in order to receive it. 

""Without a break, dream becoming bigger""
""giving up is nothing""

They still face challenges and forge ahead. It wouldn't be worth it to give up.


Both songs discuss the groups chasing after their dreams. ""Given-Taken"" expresses more doubt and uncertainty, not knowing what fate lies ahead but choosing to pursue their aspirations anyways. They choose to jump into the unknown, even while fearing it. They pose the question of whether their success was given or if it was taken. By the end of the song they choose to take it. ""The Great Mermaid"" discusses how they want to control that narrative from the beginning. How society romanticizes female sacrifice, and they refuse to do the same. That they want to choose who they are despite what might be taken. They want to choose what is given and their fate will be decided by only them. 

In ""Given-taken"", Enhypen is haunted by the weight of being chosen and in ""The Great Mermaid"", Le Sserafim refuses to be anyone's choice. These songs express identity, power, and the choice to take what you deserve.

Both beautiful and meaningful songs that really play well off of each other and pair well together.",49,3

nwjns have a solid discography too like putting aside everything that happen the past few months u cant really deny how good their discography are 🥲 its a shame though what happened

kpop_uncensored,1kg6f2y,2025-05-06 16:50:49,Songs That Pair Well?,"I saw a post that said TXT's ""Love Language"" and Twice's ""Scientist"" seem like different perspectives of the same concept. What are some songs from two different artists that pair well together, or sound like they're responding to each other?

Songs I think pair well:

""Icky"" by Kard and ""Loco"" by Itzy

""Tail"" by Sunmi and ""Move"" by Taemin

""Love Me Like This"" by Nmixx and ""Kitsch"" by IVE


Songs I think respond to each other:

""Given-Taken"" by Enhypen and ""The Great Mermaid"" by Le Sserafim

( The Great Mermaid and Given-Taken both explore transformation through different angles. The Great Mermaid through rebellion and refusing to sacrifice and Given-Taken through doubt and introspection. But they both deal with the complexity of achieving their aspirations and becoming someone new)


""If I Say, I Love You"" by Boy Next Door and ""Tick-Tack"" by Illit

(Both songs focus on feelings of attraction and 
being drawn to someone. Tick-Tack is a clumsy form of love with youthful exploration, If I Say I Love You is a more hesitant version, scared to confess these feelings they have)

""Cry for Me"" by Twice and ""Still Monster"" by Enhypen

(Both talk about pain in love from different perspectives. Cry for me discusses wanting their partner to feel the pain they've felt and loving a flawed person and choosing to stay. Still Monster discusses being that flawed person and hiding away from their partner and causing them pain)

Edit:
""Accendio"" by Ive and ""Fever"" by Enhypen feel like they're responding to each other too.

Accendio- ""affectionate but cold as ice, gonna make you crazy"" ""pupils dyed with colors never seen before""

Fever- ""The icy eyes, red eyes, breaking me in two they shake me""

Accendio- ""watch me, don't touch me""

Fever- ""I can't touch you, never""

Accendio- ""cast a spell, Accendio""

Fever- ""My body burns because of you""

kpop_uncensored,1kgcyj7,2025-05-06 21:12:24,The topic of sexualization of kpop idols,"so i just read a post on this sub about kpop idols being sexualized and the OP brought up enhypen as an example, and i saw a few comments about how certain kpop idols (that are adults) do sexualize themselves sometimes, which there is nothing wrong with that. 

i guess i’m more in the middle with this topic because i’m 20, so i’m around the age of the people i stan or younger than them so it doesn’t bother me as much? obviously i would never condone thirst comments for minors or people who had JUST turned 18 because i do believe that that is predatory behavior. ( i unfortunately have seen weird comments made to Ni-ki and Eunchae on tiktok & twt).

I know how Ni-ki has been getting strange comments since before he turned of age but now that all of enhypen are adults and doing a mature concept for their new comeback, how do you guys feel about the new people who will start to sexualize kpop idols even more because of these concepts? 

Will the fans who don’t like it or uncomfortable with it keep complaining or will it just be a lost cause to even talk about it anymore?

would it still be weird for people to make thirst comments if the idols are deliberately going for a sexy concept, with suggestive and mature lyrics, dancing, posing etc?",33,16
kpop_uncensored,1kesbvk,2025-05-04 21:36:05,sexualisation of kpop idols never sat right with me,"i have a feeling this might get downvoted a lot but oh well.

lately, as an engene, i’ve been noticing a huge rise in sexualising comments about enhypen. like, even a simple edit of the members ends up with replies like “raw and deep” or whatever else. and tbh, it’s starting to become really weird. i know some people might just be joking or whatever, but at the end of the day, these are real people like imagine if they actually saw those comments.

and i feel like this kind of sexualisation is way too normalised in boy group fandoms especially with groups like ateez and bts.

also, i’ve seen some questionable stuff about eunchae from le sserafim too, and she only just turned 18 not long ago… yeah, that’s a bit weird if you ask me ngl. ",276,67
kpop_uncensored,1kdy69b,2025-05-03 19:23:29,One of the greatest relationships in kpop has hit a milestone. K and Taki's father son duo.,"I'll just leave [K's message](https://x.com/andTEAM_members/status/1918695934197932393?s=19) here (read context* below)

""You're finally turned 20 years old.
I've always thought you were a baby, but you're a great adult now. I am really happy to meet someone called Taki who is too nice for me.
I'm glad to see you grow for six years without missing a day. 

When I was a trainee, I actually studied TOPIK (korean Lang test) hard to show good performance to Taki, and I wanted him to be a good eater, so I ate every grain of rice in front of Taki Lol.

I don't know if I had a good influence, but I'm as happy as I am when I see Taki, who has the power to make so many people happy. Let's be the best team in the future and watch the best scenery together.

To my beloved brother 💛 Congratulations 🥳""


*Context: K(22) and Taki(14) are Japanese trainees of hybe who participated in their survival show iLand in 2020. There were only 3 jtrainees, the other being ni-ki(14 of enhypen). K and Taki later debuted together in &Team(2022).

 Before the show started K made good friends with them, like a big brother. These two kids would look up to K, and he took them under his wing. A cute story is that when Taki and ni-ki finished training at 5pm, they would stay in McD till 10pm just to go home with K.

We saw this father son relationship between K and Taki a lot during the iland show. But we recently found out that they actually were not allowed to show any familiarity or closeless to each other. And K said that he almost got sent back to Japan because of this. 

And even in this [recent post](https://x.com/andTEAM_members/status/1918696375006441953?s=19), we see a 14 y.o Taki eating by himself whilst K films him because he thought it was cute. 

""We weren't supposed to talk to each other."" -K

Implying even outside the show they couldn't interact. But K still ate at another table looking at Taki. He sent this video to Taki's mom. 

This is [quote](https://youtu.be/wHF16YAuoRw?si=DgLnZK69pDBOCCny) from Taki mom.
""lf l think of Taki, I can't stop crying So l'lI read this paper, which I wrote 
I remember the first time when he went to Korea 
(K is taking care of Taki) He was a middle school student, and it was first time to be on a airplane 
I received a photo when he arrived in Korea.
He looked really scared and anxious Next day, he called me that he's lonely. He wore very thin jacket in the winter. He's surprising me a lot, so I'm very worried about him 
So I often asked K to take care of him K! Thank you so much 
He's very unique kid, but please take a good care of him.""

I made this post to highlight the feel good friendships in kpop, though the hardships, they survived two survival shows and debuted in Hybe(big4) of all places. Also K is always mischaracterised by the shows evil editing (fake reactions+ not showing everything) + haters. But honestly out of my 10years in kpop he's the kindest idol I've seen. 

To those who think K and ni-ki don't get along. Here's [Ni-ki calling K](https://x.com/nancieee127/status/1908278661117038608?s=19) for his birthday and admitting they call almost everyday. 

Tldr. K (22) raised Taki(14) for 6 years. They ended up in the same group &Team, and today is Taki's 20th birthday.",160,16
kpop_uncensored,1kbo06k,2025-04-30 20:42:05,He has enough of this being mentioned so guys stop leaving messages or comments because clearly HE DOESN'T LIKE IT ANYMORE,"For everyone asking who this Twitter Account is simple this Daniel from I-Land and why you guys are asking he posted because he doesn't like it anymore becase every fans keeps living comments in his IG account and when he does live they always bring up him during I-Land when Daniel no longer wanted to be associated with that Program 

Sure it did Daniel gave popurality and gets some fans but let's not pretend how that show truly DRAINED, EXHAUSTED, EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY DAMAGE and BROKE every single contestants that participated in that program even Enhypen themselves looks so uncomfortable even I notice they how uncomfortable when a fan tried bring up I-Land and trust me neither Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon,Sunoo and Ni-ki would like to even hear those words and remember due to the severe impact in their mental health 

And I am not just talking about Enhypen other contestants who competed in I-Land like &Team K, Taki, EJ and Nicholas do not want to even want to hear or mentioned due to the intense suffering they have to endure in their mental health especially K who suffered the Evil Editing from the Program

I do understand some of you that Daniel should be grateful since if it weren't for I-Land Daniel would never be noticed or be famous however that Daniel no longer EXIST, that's another reason why he change his name from Daniel or Kyu because many only remembers that version of him but he is no longer that Version he is now Kyu not Daniel 

You can complain all you want but let's be real I-Land was truly a TRAUMATIZING SURVIVAL SHOW and compared towards other Idol Survival Shows this for me up to date is the most MENTAL TRAUMATIZING SURVIVAL SHOW so Far",38,26
kpop_uncensored,1k9z3zg,2025-04-28 17:59:57,Is there some sort of organised attack or bot attack on kpop TikTok rn?,"I get a majority BTS TikTok’s on my fyp cause they’re the only group I stan, but I do get TikTok’s about some other groups popping up every now and then, and I noticed the comments on them were all this spam about Enhypen and SKZ being better than each other and being better than Twice or BTS, and people saying “(X group) next to Moonbin” or “(X group) next to Sulli” etc… it’s been almost relentless, and today I noticed the spamming of the same stuff has started popping up on the videos on the official BTS tiktok page too…

kpop_uncensored,1k3jguo,2025-04-20 12:17:17,Enhypen at Coachella: The reward of their hard work,"I just came across this [video](https://x.com/Kiandreilla/status/1913842460108923217) of Enhypen at Coachella, once again showing that they were singing live. But beyond the performance itself, watching it made me feel the need to write - to shine a light on the journey they’ve taken to reach this moment. These two weeks at Coachella are the result of years of hard work and growth, and as a fan, I couldn’t be prouder of them and of getting to walk even a small part of this journey alongside them.

Over the past three years of following them (i've also watched them during iland), I’ve seen these boys gradually develop a genuine passion for music, becoming more and more sincere in their approach with this art form, building a strong desire to grow and become better. They’ve never stopped expressing how much they want to become true artists and prove that they do, in fact, have a rightful place in this industry.

I’ve watched them take initiatives, never take anything for granted, embrace new challenges, and when faced with criticism, they always found a way to learn from it and correct their mistakes. But above all, I’ve watched them grow in confidence : both as a group and individually. There’s something profoundly moving about watching someone you admire blossom in self-assurance, a sincere pride that resonates deep within. That’s exactly how I felt watching them perform today with unwavering confidence, an insatiable desire for more, and a powerful conviction to keep pushing themselves further, again and again.

I'm proud of them, of how far they've come, and of the journey that still lies ahead. Coachella was just another chapter in their journey to showcase what they are capable of and with the future opportunities that will surely come their way, I can’t help but feel excited for what’s to come.

I truly hope that through the powerful performances they delivered at Enchella, their sincerity reached even more people, and that it sparked inspiration for those finding their own way through passion and purpose.

kpop_uncensored,1k5wead,2025-04-23 13:05:57,can we talk about the sudden surge of disturbing tiktok comments wishing idols harm?,"I’ve noticed a lot of fandoms bring up the really disturbing comments that they’ve found on tiktok so I just wanted to share so we can work together to get rid of these accounts.

The comments are usually under enhypen pfps, or the occasional njz or carmen from h2h pfp, and are constantly commenting disturbing things referencing moonbin or sulli. I’ve seen them comment on lsf’s account, stray kids’, nct’s , exo’s, treasure etc. 

We’ve found out that these all seem to be indonesian kori stans / korizens who is a tiktoker. Many of them rebranded to enhypen stan accounts a bit before coachella to comment disturbing things and to set enhypen and engenes up (which has worked very well for them so they haven’t gotten bored yet). They all seem to comment very similar things which shows there seems to be a certain amount of planning involved. 

I’m asking y’all to please report these accounts and do not engage. The more you reply to a comment, the higher up the comment section it goes, the more likely it is for idol’s to see the comment. The thing is, it’s really easy to create burner accounts on tiktok so I’m not sure what the best solution is, but we can’t keep giving trolls the attention they want 😭 korizens are targeting enhypen bc they had a fanwar with Indonesian engenes apparently, I think before that some of them were pretending to be tokkis during the MHJ hybe drama. 

I just want to clarify that these accounts aren’t actually engenes, tokkis or carmen stans. I thought most people would be able to tell these comments are rage bait, but evidently I think the situation needs clarification and the fact that this is organised needs to be highlighted.

kpop_uncensored,1k7hz4d,2025-04-25 12:52:07,Loud Backtracks Are Not the Reason Why K-pop Groups Are Struggling to Make It Big in the West & Coachella rant,"Loud Backtracks Are Not the Reason Why K-pop Groups Are Struggling to Make It Big in the West


A lot of people seem to think that the reason why kpop groups are not that popular in the west is because loud back tracks, but actually artist like Tate, Justin Bieber, & Sza have really loud backtracks. 
People seem to think that the reason why  BTS is so big in the west is because they sing live, it is one of the reasons but theres so much more than that.

I remember going to my first Justin Bieber concert in 2013 and i realized that half of his show was playback and the other half live, and thats ok because he had an awful touring schedule so ofc he was not gonna be able to sing all those shows without a lil help from playback.

But now i realized, he connects really well with the audience, i remember he hyped the crowd and also had a dj doing that, despite not singing the entire show live he DID connect with the audience.

I do realize groups are held up to a higher standard sometimes than solo artist when it comes to singing, its not the same a solo artist lip syncing a performance than a group, because a group can back each other up and dont have to sing an entire song alone.

Charlie XCX is arguably not a good singer but she HYPES the crowd, everyone can feel her energy.

So i believe the main reasons kpop groups are not making it in the west are.

- Not being able to connect with the audience, they perform for a camera not for the public
- Sometimes they focus too much on perfection to the point they look like machines, the west loves when things feel organic
- KPOP lacks creative freedom 

But most important thing to make it in the west is GOOD MUSIC, or at least easy to listen to, i love nct but a track like sticker is never going to be big in the west.


——
Extra: i feel like some groups could be bigger in the west if they focus more on organic performances (some groups just focus a lot on coming off as sexy or cool and sometimes that causes ppl to cringe btw)

Like Enhypen already has GOOD music, im a casual listener, but i saw a few clips of their concert before cochella and i thought they were really good, but when i went to their coachella performance it seemed lackluster, it led me down because i feel like they focused too much on looking cool and forgot to connect with the audience, idk that might be just me but i felt like their concert performances were better than coachella. 
(JAY WAS UNREAL BTW, NEW BIAS UNLOCKED, HE WAS ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE AUDIENCE SO WELL) but maybe the set list was just a bit boring.
They were trying to hard to be cool, idk i just feel like their concerts are better

I also saw Jennie (and i didnt really listen to her album because the few songs that i heard i didnt like them) but omg her set was soooo good, you could feel her connecting with the crowd, she was not performing for the cameras, she was jumping with everyone, even when she was out of breath she did a really good job.

I really don't know how you could just hate a group that just debuted that makes no sense you have no information about them, they've not posted a song yet and you're just hating on them. that's just straight up wrong on all levels.  Especially with the new controversy and Legal battle with NJZ. I feel like theres was really no point of njz joining the legal battle. They just ruined their whole career in their life just because they wanted a horrible CEO that never even cared about them and used them for power and money. The funny thing is that njz probably knew what Min heejin did because it was all over the Internet like everywhere new sites and on Reddit and stuff like that (bye the way she's accused of covering up s3xu@l assault case).I don't really know why NJZ really thought that she was going to continue making music for them because she was even exposed on the group chats with their parents and how she talks so badly about them and you get easy tell that she was using them for just money and to get what she wanted didn't care about what anybody else thought I honestly feel bad for njz but I mean they chose the decision in the end and I hope that they can get back on track but how it's looking I don't think that's how it's going to go.  .A group just debuted and instead of congratulating them and being happy. y'all are just bashing this new group just because they have some so-called ""similar concept to NJZ, and I feel like the only reason why they bring illit into the problem was because njz was having their own problems. Bunnies needed to relieve the stress and problems that they had, and were basically saying that hype an adora was trying to cover up NJZ's legal problems.  NJZ does not own the concept. Obviously not all of the bunnies are attacking illit they're supporting them but most of them are just bashing them and they're being delusional and as a bunny myself I am disapointed in the fandom. Toxic bunnies are just being hypocritical because njz copied another groups concept. So saying Illit is hypocritical for copying NJZ's concept is crazy to me.

kpop_uncensored,1jj7bj4,2025-03-25 01:58:41,I kinda love being a hybe stan,"Little dumb very unserious rant but all the multi kpop fans I follow on twitter, insta,  etc.. can easily say they love being an SM stan, JYP stan or hell a YG stan.. Starship idc.. name it. How they love all their idols. So why would my ass be ashamed into saying I love being a Hybe stan? Because a lot of them want to make me feel like I should. It's like you can barely say it sometimes without getting harrassed on some of these platforms?

I don't worship the company at all, there's a looot of stuff they do I don't agree with (like every single K-pop company) but people act like you do when you say you like Hybe idols? I LOOOVE HYBE IDOLS. I love most of their songs. Even if I don't full-time stan the group there is at least a few of their songs I will like. So I want to compliment them a little:

I love the girl groups. Love ILLIT, love LE SSERAFIM, love KATSEYE so much. Their music and personalities are so cute and good to me.

Enhypen & TXT's discographies are literally up there as one of the best boygroup discographies ever in my opinion. (They're one of the only boygroups I bother checking out sometimes)

TWS & BOYNEXTDOOR have such cute bops here and there. They're handling the two new bgs so well in Korea. (Especially BND) I've seen so many posts of how many fans they've gained. Love that for them. 

And of course BTS & SEVETEEN. Like I love Seventeentan down. They're so iconic and I was so overjoyed to see them join each other through Hybe. Like Super was on REPEAT. and Bts's songs are sooo iconic. Tannies are legends.. like literally.

I just love seeing all of them together and do challenges. 🥺

I kinda wish HYBE would be a little like SM on that regard and give us more of that company family feel 😔 like have family portraits together and stuff. Eventho I know all labels are different.

I hope we can have them all play games together in the future again including bts this time!!

It was a rough time for me and I’ve used music as a way of coping with life and to cheer myself up. Due to the hardships and obstacles that K-Pop idols go through and how they all meant to me as inspirational role models/indirect friends, I just can’t help but cry sometimes and have a caring approach when I think about them. Like if IU or Jungkook or Jake of ENHYPEN crosses my mind?

kpop_uncensored,1j77jji,2025-03-09 14:23:39,How did MYs became so vicious as a fandom?,"
Recently Jhope released Sweet Dreams ft Miguel and he has been doing TikTok challenge videos with different idols. So far, the reaction from other fans have been mostly positive. Fans of twice, enhypen, shinee, ateez- all have been very exciting. But when he did a challenge with Aespa karina, the fans became rabid. They made hundreds of posts all across social media and blogs on how karina was forced to do it, insulting Jhope’s visual with casual racism and accusing him (a literal bts member) of using aespa clout. This reminded me how mys acted similarly when namjoon and karina was seated at an event and the fans attacked namjoon wotj disturbing amount of racism. 

MYs also have been harassing lesserafim and illit ever since the Min heejin drama started. They have been using bang pd’s texts on how he wanna “crush” aespa to abuse the girls from other ggs. They are often in the forefront of hate campaign all over social media. They are also regularly making fun of Itzy and how they are “flop”. The fans made Karina break up with her bf just after few weeks of dating . Any time a group or idol has vocal mishaps during a live show, they’ll be the first ones to make hate posts even though aespa is known for lip syncing a lot.

I wanna know how did MYs became like this ? Obviously not everyone is like this but when and how did the fandom become so toxic but still manage to fly under the radar when there’s discourse about toxic fandoms. ",1009,293

kpop_uncensored,1j5o79v,2025-03-07 14:48:26,I've been to 15 K-Pop concerts and here is what I thought of each of them,"* **Sunmi** – *Good Girl Gone Mad Tour* (Amsterdam) - my first K-pop concert!! It was really exciting and I remember how hyped I felt. Sunmi really delivered, it was a rather small venue but she did a great job with her back up dancers and interacted really nicely with the crowd. You could simply tell that she has a ton of experience performing and engaging an audience. It was captivating, her vocals were great, her dancing too. She even picked up a pride flag, and I loved that she had the autonomy to do so. 

* **(G)I-DLE** – *I am FREE-TY World Tour* (Amsterdam) - they are my ult group and I got a VIP ticket, hence I was in the second row. Of course, I might be biased but it was truly amazing. Live vocals throughout the entire show, amazing energy, Yuqi and Miyeon are hilarious and very talkative, good solo stages and fan service too. It was very apparent that they love performing. The concert was really well paced and the VCRs were produced well too! Mid-sized venue.

* **(G)I-DLE** – *I am FREE-TY World Tour* (Brussels) - it was the same show as in Amsterdam, but I had nosebleed seats. This show happened to be on my birthday, so I went again cuz when am I ever gonna see my favorite group on my birthday again? Basically very similar to the Amsterdam show, no further comments. 

* **TWICE** – *Ready to Be World Tour* (Berlin) - flew all the way to Berlin from Amsterdam and it was so worth it. I had a GA ticket and it was the longest K-pop concert I've attended, it was 3 hours long! Great energy on stage, 9 solo stages, amazing vocals, outfits and stage presence. They are a household name for a reason and their experience really showed on stage. It was just so satisfying seeing their performances and the show was well budgeted too, in an arena size venue. 

* **aespa** – *SYNK: Hyper Line Tour* (Berlin) - aespa is my second favorite group and they played a very small venue, although it was aespa's first tour in Europe, I'm sure they could have definitely gone bigger. Unfortunately, they lipsynced a lot (basically whenever there was a lot of choreography and all solo stages were lipsynced) and they did not interact much with the audience. It was also weird none of the members spoke English at all, even Giselle only spoke Korean throughout the entire show, so they had an interpreter. I remember the VCRs to be very long too. Focus was more on visuals and lots of outfit changes, imo.

* **PIXY** – *Last Night In The Dark City Tour (*Amsterdam) - sadly one of the worst shows I've been to. The budget was low and it did not go smoothly. At one point a member ran off stage mid song, then they only came back as 3 during the encore at first, Rinji then joined the encore a bit later which was strange. They also did a dance cover of Queencard. All songs with choreography were lipsynced, songs performed with handheld mics were live. Super small venue too. 

* **EVERGLOW** – *All My Girls Tour* (Amsterdam) - I love EVERGLOW and their energy was absolutely insane. I guess you also need that energy to pull off their songs. Unfortunately, all songs with choreography were lipsynced and they used handheld mics for songs they sang live. It was fun, but budget was also low, they did not even have an outfit change or backup dancers even though the ticket was not cheap. Overall, it was fun, but I'm not sure it was worth the price point of the ticket? It was a small venue. 

* **ONEUS** – *La Dolce Vita Tour* (Tilburg) - I am more of a girl group stan, but the show was crazy good. Insane energy, great live vocals, and very funny interactions and crowd engagement. VCRs were also great and of high quality. They are great live performers and I feel like their songs are made to be performed live. It was a smaller venue too, but they still had backup dancers and outfit changes.

* **OnlyOneOf** – *dOpamine World Tour* (Amsterdam) - I'm not really a huge fan, but the tickets were cheap so I went. Overall, I was positively surprised. It was a tiny venue, but they made it work. Good vocals, good energy and despite not knowing most of their songs, it was super fun. A lot of fan service too and the guys seemed to have enjoyed themselves. Of course the budget was low, but that was to be expected. 

* **IVE** \- *Show What I Have World Tour* (Amsterdam) - I was so positively surprised by IVE, I didn't think they would blow me away but that's exactly what happened. Absolutely fantastic energy on stage, surprisingly great live vocals and dancing, beautiful outfits and really well paced concert. There was no boring moment at all and it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to. Also arena-size venue. 

* **NCT Dream** – *The Dream Show 3: Dream( )scape* (Rotterdam) - mostly just went because a friend got tickets, don't have many thoughts on it, to be honest. Some songs were quite hype like Smoothie and they sang live for the most part too. I think they had one or two outfit changes. It was fun, but nothing too memorable for me.

* **ATEEZ** – *Towards The Light: Will To Power* (Amsterdam) - this show was crazy. The members truly gave their all during the entire show, it was epic, showstopping and absolutely insane. It felt like I had to hold my breath during certain killing parts. I had so much fun and was screaming, dancing and feeling the energy. I also loved the acting and storytelling in their performances, the high-budget production and the live vocals. They really proved how amazing and strong they are as performers. Simply captivating. 

* **Kiss of Life** – *1st World Tour Kiss Road* (Utrecht) - they did really well, given how new they are. Amazing live vocals and charisma. The show itself was a bit short and low-budgeted, but I am sure they can return on a bigger stage with more budget next time. I would definitely go again! Some nice fan service such as the Kissy Chair were included. It also helps that they spoke English, it really makes a difference when it comes to connecting with the audience. 

* **aespa** – *SYNK: Parallel Line Tour* (Amsterdam) - as I was a little disappointed by the aespa concert in Berlin in 2023, I was hoping to love this tour more. Sadly, the energy was really lacking and the crowd wasn't giving anything back in return. It did not help that 2/3 of the songs were lipsynced, including the solo stages. This time I also noticed how little they talked and interacted with the crowd. I know they are not the strongest English speakers, but even Giselle wasn't saying anything substantial in English, it seemed a bit awkward. The visuals were amazing tho, but sadly the VCRs were also really long and nobody seemed to care about naevis. They also did not do much with the stage design, you would expect SM to have more budget. I still love their music and concepts, but unfortunately I am not sure I would pay money to see them again, especially given the ticket prices. 

I also went to **Kpop.Flex** in Frankfurt (Mamamoo, IVE, Kai, (G)I-DLE, Monsta X, Dreamcatcher, AB6IX), **Circle Music Charts Awards** in Seoul (STAYC, Kep1er, TXT, aespa, Seventeen BSS, Enhypen, Yena, B'EO) and **Music Bank** in Antwerp (ZEROBASEONE, STAYC, TXT, Riize, (G)I-DLE, ONEUS). 

Later this year I am going to **Taemin** (Tilburg), **TXT** (Amsterdam), and **Stray Kids** (Amsterdam), so I have a good judgement and understanding of K-pop concerts and live performances. ",51,35

kpop_uncensored,1j2lxr5,2025-03-03 17:00:02,I love this speech Ni-Ki made about the unseen people behind the scenes,"If you don't know Ni-Ki, he's Enhypen's maknae with a cool, almost mysterious vibe. He's actually quite thoughtful and introspective. He's not the type to be super affectionate with words but every now and then, on Weverse live, he'll open up. Most of the time, it's about how much he loves the members but this time it's about the staff behind the scenes.


I guess he was feeling nostalgic and wanted to talk about how grateful he is for the people around him. I thought it was a really touching and observant thing to say for an 18-year old idol.


>""I realized my gratitude for it. The fascinating thing is, we go to like quick change booths, right? The way going there is really complicated. Like, there's metal and stuff. You have to move while crouching down. Those kinds of equipment... it's something we just can't do. It's the way they built this stage for us. Also how they lent us the venue.


>The fact that we can get our hair and makeup done. That we can wear our stage costumes. The way they shine the light on us. And you even do the message cards, you prepare those for us. The catering is prepared. Even the cars that are prepared so that we can go to the venue. The hotels that are reserved for us. And when the concert is over, they make sure to reserve a place for us to eat. The way we can we get a massage before the concert. The way we can do rehearsals. The way the dancers stick with us. 


>Just everything, everything.


>There's nothing that we can do on our own. In that aspect, I'm able to feel so grateful. They put in so much attention and care for us. I realized the gratitude I have for the staff who help us.""

kpop_uncensored,1j2hbyg,2025-03-03 13:14:57,Baemon is moving different,"Baemon today just completed their LA concert. I must say, i just attended because of my sister but i left as a fan. They were 90-95% live with minimal backtrack and never once lipsynced. Some groups do lipsync during their concerts and they get flamed for that, eg aespa which i went recently too. But, not Baemon and they sound incredible. Not just that, their stage presence and intensity made everyone in the arena jumping! By far the best kpop girl group concert i went so far.

But thats not why i am ranting. I saw on twitter that they join aespa, bp, twice, mamamoo, itzy and ive to hold a solo concert at KIA Forum. Granted, it might sound normal but Baemon is doing this in their ROOKIE Year! And they actually sold out the place! It was packed! I dont think anyone of these groups that I mentioned did any touring during their first year or even have the guts to do it. When i first heard they coming to US, i thought they will do multiple smaller venues like theaters like Kiof but they went straight to big arenas. Alot of peeps on twitter and even myself didnt see them selling out but damn. Yg really knows his new girl group’s popularity. They proved me wrong and in the process, made me a fan.

There were talks about because of Yg deficit, thats why he sending the girls to tour. I mean, if they can sell out arena, why not? My sis told me they sold out all their Japan dates totalling 150k attendees and their seoul dates one of the highest in the specific arena. If i am yg, i will send them to tour too. Like talent wise and popularity wise, they are ready. What i saw today, the amount of people gathered for them, i was stupid to think they werent ready.

I saw people on twitter saying bm not making money for the company thats why yg in deficit. First of all, touring and album sales makes money for company. Merch too. Other companies had multiple artists touring. Jyp with skz, twice and itzy. Hybe, enhypen, txt and seventeen and etc. Sm with the multiple nct groups, aespa and some older artist like shinee. Yg only had treasure and they only did a mini one. Baemon a rookie, how to tour last year? If we talk sales, they are literally the highest in sales in their generation. Cant get better than that. Its just not enough artists to breakeven. But now since they are monetizing with the tour, bp, 2ne1 and trs all going tour, no issue for me. And they will debut a new group so more IPs.

I am really excited to see how much Baemon will grow. They are really something special. To me, they have no competition in their generation. They are leaping far ahead with this tour. Hope to see them soon in a stadium tour just like their big sisters!

I think tours as tiring they can be they are honestly so beneficial for idols, im not familiar with many groups so I’ll use enhypen as an example. I’ve been a fan of them since debut and honestly I saw an immediate shift and improvement in their vocals from 2022 to 2023. 2022 being when they first started their manifesto tour, idk if it’s because they got so used to singing live so much but honestly their vocals improved so much, especially Ni-ki. I also want to highlight their music shows prior to tour you could see that they were lip syncing often but now I can barely tell the difference, I believe a lot of their performances on music shows but there’s someone that can tell the difference but I honestly can’t.",15,9

some more context :

The IFPI Global Artist Chart and IFPI Global Album Chart include all Physical and Digital consumption formats, which are converted by region according to the relative economics (revenue per unit of consumption) of each. All consumption is  converted into Album Equivalent Units according to these conversion rates and forms the chart rankings. Due to the sensitive nature of the data used for these conversions, chart units are not published.

The IFPI Global Album Sales Chart considers only physical album sales as well as full album downloads. Rather than being converted, these sales are counted on a unit basis, which forms the chart rankings.",155,100

I was introduced to kpop by GOT7, after binge watching their content and listening to their music I quickly added Taemin, then NCT and Monsta X I've never stanned BTS and Blackpink, just listen to their music when it comes on recommendations (I still mix up Jhope, Jin and Suga). 

""All night"" got me into ASTRO more than the other groups for a bit, which got me into k-dramas.

Then over the years I would check out whatever was popular, EXO, Twice, Ive, Aespa, TxT, Enhypen, God's menu, Ateez, Everglow.

After lock down I took a break from kpop for a bit but boys planet pulled me back in. Now I Stan ZB1. I bought their first album but stopped keeping up with everything they do afterwards (not that there was much group content to keep up with), now I'm a solo Stan (yeah, yeah I know!) because irl things really does not allow me to hard Stan a whole group anymore. Jebewon is actually the first group that made me buy anything Kpop related.

The emotions, the drama, the poetry, the visuals, like wow. They do their forever yearning niche incredibly well.

I listen to songs from most groups, and  there are some songs that, for whatever reason, make me teary-eyed or emotional even though they’re not necessarily sad.

For example:

* **ENHYPEN – ""HIGHWAY 1009""** I’m not an ENGENE, but I am a fan of ENHYPEN. This song is hands down my #1 favorite from them. I’ve heard it’s dedicated to ENGENEs, and you can really feel the love in it. The song itself isn’t very sad, but the beautiful vocals and melody always make me teary when I listen to it.
* **BABYMONSTER – ""DREAM""** This song makes me cry because it reminds me of how dreams can feel so far away for me. Maybe it’s because I feel like my dreams will never come true like theirs, or because seeing others achieve their dreams makes me proud and emotional at the same time. It’s not just the lyrics, it’s the way the song feels.

I think everyone has those songs that aren’t necessarily sad but still make you emotional for personal reasons or because of your own story. ",30,44

(My ults are skz,ateez,and enhypen) 

My favorite thing about them is 

1. They all have amazing sp and always sing live. And their live vocals are amazing. They also never lack in dance either and never fail to deliver.

2. For skz, i find it very admirable that they write,produce, and compose their own songs. They also never lack in anything, like rap, dance, vocals, visuals etc. 

3. For ateez, they never fail to deliver. Like anything, they have such powerful and captivating stages it just never fails to amaze me. 

 4. And for Enhypen, even though they dont participate in more rap leaning music they still make some of the best music in the industry imo. And their stages!!! As a group who started so young and from such a traumatic survival i am just so proud of how big they have become. Their dance, sp, live vocals, and just everything never fail. They eat up everything they do and still manage to keep going even after undergoing such harsh work conditions. ",103,47
kpop_uncensored,1hv04xa,2025-01-06 15:23:14,Fan-loved hidden gems by your idols that you DONT enjoy? ,"Okay so yesterday somebody posted about ""hidden gems from artists you don't listen to"" and I misunderstood it as ""hidden gems from artists you stan but DONT like"". And I thought, why not make a post about that.

So, what are less popular songs that are often acclaimed by the fandom --because let's be realistic, it's rarely the popular ones that are actual fan favorites-- and you actually don't care about, or even dislike them?

For example, I don't like BTS' Zero O Clock. I just don't. It annoys me, I find it average. I don't know 😭 but I'm sure that's a very unpopular opinion as those kind of bsides are often well liked by Armys. Another one by BTS would be Make It Right. 

For Enhypen I'd say Flicker. I just don't care for that song and many engenes claim it as one of their best ones.

*please bring up fan favorite ""hidden gems"" to this thread. I don't wanna see a ""Dynamite 🥺"" ""How you like that 🫢"" type of comment.... HIDDEN GEMS...SONGS THAT ARENT AS POPULAR AND THE FANDOM LIKES 🙏😩",31,101

1. Stray kids x Ateez x Enhypen collab (even if its just a special stage) 

2. Stray kids releases an album or mini album thats based mainly on vocals (or even just a title track) ik it might seem unlikely but i rlly want it to happen

3. vocalist maknaes special stage (Specifically, SKZ: I.N, ATEEZ: Jungho, Aespa:Ningning,Kep1er: Yougeun, BTS: Jungkook,and BM: Chiquita) 

4. Enhypen and Stray kids taking a break. Its genuinely unhealthy atp

5. This one is broad but, More full albums being released than multiple mini albums in a year. I get they want a chance to promote different styles and tracks but it gets hard to keep up with so many releases. I would rather just have one full album

What group do you think have the best discography in kpop? Like everything that they released is just so good.
To me it's 
Enhypen - Releasing moonstruck and fatal Trouble in the same year is a bang. I don't worry if my playlist is in shuffle mode 'coz their songs are no skip
Red Velvet - Psycho was a reset. Their songs are just superb
Ive - I would literally want to debut with the concept they have and with the music they release. 
Txt - They belong to the few bg that releases good music. I'm addicted listening to De javu lately.

kpop_uncensored,1hm73vp,2024-12-25 20:23:53,"Pet peeve: An idol being pitch-perfect while singing DOES NOT mean they have perfect pitch + other terrible usages of the term ""perfect pitch"" in K-Pop discussions","Post got longer than I expected, but bear with me.

Firstly, what does perfect pitch mean?

Perfect pitch is the ability of a person to recognize a musical note by name on hearing it, *without reference to other notes*. If you ask a person with perfect pitch to sing you a ""B"" out of the blue, they would be able to do it with no issue. Perfect pitch is very rare- it's considered to be present in about 0.01% of the population.

Perfect pitch is *not* required to be perfectly on pitch while singing. A good singer with perfect pitch has absolutely *no* advantage over a good singer without it, unless they're in a setting where they're required to sing in the original key without being given background music. I have never seen someone in such a setting. So no, your amazing singer of an idol does not have perfect pitch just because they are an amazing singer. Another thing worth noting: songs not being in the original key generally sounds incorrect to people with perfect pitch, because while the rest of us only recognize the melody (which can be scaled up or down), a person with perfect pitch would not think the music is the same if the notes themselves are different.

Here are some contexts in which I have seen people say idols have perfect pitch (I know that idols are also guilty of using the term the wrong way- that annoys me too):

Zhang Hao: When he [guested on Eunchae's Star Diary](https://youtu.be/o-nzRzDICWU?si=x7YDZbn8en-TyHer&t=336), Eunchae mentioned his supposed ""perfect pitch"" and asked him to demonstrate it. Right off the bat, Zhang Hao **asked to hear the notes once** before trying, which already disqualifies him from the discussion (and he got some of them wrong anyway, but that is beside the point).

Liz: I've seen videos of her [playing Red Flavor by Red Velvet on the recorder](https://x.com/anyujinsbitch/status/1776099911593034021) and [pointing out incorrect notes](https://x.com/vocalizts/status/1859781039671108040) being used as evidence for her having perfect pitch. In the first clip, she did not play the song in its original key. Liz has apparently played the piano since she was young, and that is enough pitch training for her to be able to play the song by ear. It does not mean she has perfect pitch, just means that she has **really good relative pitch**. In the second clip- she does not need to have perfect pitch to point out a note played out of tune, what are you even talking about?

Jungkook: Initially, I believed it because of that [one clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48wK52uRhf0) of him in Run BTS in which he is able to locate the first note immediately after hearing it. However, on checking the [full episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYmQRgFeQVg), we see that the members had asked to be able to **hear the notes once before starting** the game. When Jungkook sings impromptu in live streams, he is generally not on the same pitch as the original song. So Jungkook is another case of good relative pitch without having perfect pitch.

**TL;DR:** No, Jungkook does not have perfect pitch. No, Zhang Hao does not have perfect pitch. Neither does Liz. In fact, I cannot think of a single K-Pop idol who has perfect pitch. Please stop throwing terms around, thank you.

Edit: Heeseung from Enhypen has been brought to my attention, I believe this is one example of an idol actually having perfect pitch.

Edit 2: Maybe I should clarify if it wasn't clear enough: people have perfect pitch by birth. It is not indicative of someone's skill or talent.",188,96

Her name is Amina according to this other account in the last picture. She used to post normal kpop news and stuff but she has started talking about how she’s gonna leak nudes and numbers of idols and what not which is probably 80% a lie but it promotes stalker behaviour nevertheless. She has also started making her followers post stories which promote fake news (e.g. she used a picture which got Jake from Enhypen in a dating scandal saying it is Sunoo and he is ‘dating’). This can seriously ruin lives of some idols especially when some of these pictures aren’t even true (and in the scenario that they are true, this is just wrong to put down idols just to gain followers).

kpop_uncensored,1gexmnm,2024-10-29 16:40:03,I miss Bighit,"I know Bighit had its flaws but I do miss when BTS was their only group because it at least *felt* like they protected them from malicious behavior online and allowed them more creative freedom than other big companies. Maybe I'm looking at it with rose-colored glasses, but compared to Hybe? Bighit and Bang PD were a godsend. BTS kind of just did their own thing and it worked out because it was authentic. Now it feels like Hybe wants to use their formula over and over again, and they're fixating on the parts that can't be replicated, like trying to force an image on all of their groups that they were just a bunch of kids with a dream! When in reality, BTS had that vibe because they trained together for like 5 years before debuting and all met when they were young.

I feel sorry seeing a company with so much potential just make the worst choices over and over again. I can respect a desire to want your company be a big player, and if the other big companies around you have a legacy of decades of influential groups, you have to work hard to match up with them. But who decided the best way to do that is to obsessively compare your groups to others? To bash other groups? Even if the comments from the document are just social media comments, it's not the first time Hybe was accused of having insane marketing tactics.

I just remember being so excited when Enhypen, le sserafim, and NewJeans debuted because I thought with such a big company, they would have the resources to be more creative and experiment more freely than other groups from smaller companies could. Disappointing to see what the company's chosen to do, and how the idols are the ones suffering for it.

Edit: as someone who's been in the kpop space since 2016, I also say that Bighit seemed better because I was constantly seeing so much disappointment in the Big 3 companies. Over the years, you would see so many fans talk about how their idols were clearly being creatively stifled, how they were forced to wear things they didn't like, how their releases or tours weren't managed properly or given enough funding, how their security was so shit it allowed stalkers to get close to them, the list went on and on. And that was for all 3 big companies. So by comparison I thought Bighit was better but I could've always missed some of Bighit's behavior back then and be totally wrong about how good they were.",69,45

\---

***SM***

**Riize** \- Can defend with Riize when TWS are attacked. If someone says someone is ugly, defend with Sohee; if someone says Hanjin can’t dance, defend with the clumsy Anton.

**SM Rookie Girl Groups** \- Surprisingly, no one is pretty. Considering the shock at Aespa's debut, it seems aesthetic standards have changed.

**Aespa** \- The logic that they won't perform live because the company didn’t allow it at Coachella is shattered. From their dance mismatches, it seems they aren’t rehearsing. Teamwork has not grown at all. Even with public recognition, they can't perform, so reactions during tours will likely be poor.

**NCT** \- Their fandom has a derogatory nickname due to old-fashioned fan practices. Haechan got caught smoking indoors and tried to shield it as a chocolate bar, only to be laughed at. The reactions are horrifyingly limited compared to the response during Jungkook’s time.

**NCT Dream** \- Physically massacred by Yeonjun.

**Former Riize Seunghan** \- A kissing photo was revealed, but the community is trying to silence it, framing Seunghan as a victim. It’s puzzling why there was such a fuss during Taehyun's club incident.

\---

***JYP***

**ITZY's Yuna** \- Female idols from JYP, like Sunmi and HyunA, are exposed to a difficult environment for mental defense over the long term, leading to an emphasis on appearance or sexual appeal, a trend also seen in Yuna.

**NMIXX**\- Claims emerged that the book Haewon was reading is a feminist book. This could be used as bait, implying they team-killed while trying to earn feminist coins. / Gyujin did well on the style quiz with Eunchae, but there’s a significant physical difference between them in the challenge, making it pitiful.

**Stray Kids** \- Changbin had a similar height when filming a challenge with Nmixx. Unfortunately, since he’s friends with Yeonjun, he was physically massacred when standing next to him, which is embarrassing.

**TWICE** \- There’s a lack of significant issues.

\---

***YG***

**BLACKPINK** \- There are issues with the team not being operated cohesively.

**BABYMONSTER** \- Their training level is worse than BABYMONSTER.

\---

**HYBE**

**New Jeans** \- They need a different grouping from the existing 4th generation narrative, combining BLACKPINK, LE SSERAFIM, Aespa, and IVE. They can be discarded, and a new plan made.

**LE SSERAFIM** \- As a team that has gained trust in their performances, they can expand their tour size and create competition with boy groups / A group that combines only the advantages of BLACKPINK and TWICE.

**ILLIT** \- They need to release more viral content. Assign suitable dog breeds to each member for viral promotion on female-dominated platforms. / Youngseo seems a bit out of place.

**ENHYPEN** \- They need to drive viral content about their appearance, stage presence, and vision, emphasizing that it’s not too late to attract domestic audiences.

**TOMORROW X TOGETHER** \- They do well on stage, and just standing is meaningful. They physically massacre NCT Dream and Stray Kids. The difference between Yeonjun and Changbin seems too much. / The fanfic from their debut is now a legendary fanfic in the 4th generation. This has inflated the fantasy about the relationship between Yeonjun and Beomgyu. Fans need dramatic moments.

**SEVENTEEN** \- During their rising period, the lack of coupling was alarming, leading to speculation that it would be hard to grow and maintain their fandom. However, they opened a new era of fandom. / If SEVENTEEN performs at the top-tier Ratchamangkala in Thailand, where a Thai superstar is performing, it would be meaningful for viral promotion.

\---

***Others***

**DKZ**\- The members are surprisingly unattractive; there’s a reason they haven’t gained traction.

**ZB1**\- The level of unattractiveness is unbearable.

**IVE** \- They maintain fandom discipline while participating in female-oriented communities.

**(G)I-DLE** \- Public opinion has worsened since teaser photos. Their styling resembles 2NE1 cosplay, and the outfits, like bikinis, have been criticized for being plagiarized from overseas shopping sites.

As an engene, I’m a little conflicted. So I did hear that we are suppose to boycott the tour due to Belift overworking the boys.

They took out songs that had intense choreography & would hurt their bodies like Criminal love (rip haha). I was all for boycotting it but now that I learned that they were the head hunchos of this tour, I’m a little conflicted if I should go see them or not. I live in the US btw.

kpop_uncensored,1fw4xyv,2024-10-04 19:35:35,Types of kpop fans *for fun*,"In kpop, there are three types of fans:

the ☠️📢💯🤯🥵🫦🐕 fan,

And the 🥹🤩🫰💞🤪💋💍 fan, which is basically a koreaboo and delusional person all in one.

The 🎀❤️‍🩹✨🍓🫧👏🥰 fan lives for the aesthetic and experience, from curating cute photocard collections to attending concerts in perfect outfits and makeup. Often biasing cuties (I’m looking at all the sunoo and yeosang stans). Their love for aesthetics shines in their social media and fan creations, making K-pop fandom life look effortlessly beautiful and fun.

the ☠️📢💯🤯🥵🫦🐕 type of fans are THIRSTYYY. *Most*

The 🥹🤩🫰💞🤪💋💍 type of fans are *way* too enthusiastic, over-the-top, and they strongly blur the line between admiration and obsession. They’re often deeply immersed in K-pop (and Korean) culture, to the point of being a ""koreaboo"" and can be *veryy*

And there are the ones that switch based on the group, aka me.

kpop_uncensored,1frzna6,2024-09-29 10:20:08,I would love to see Hybe Game caterers Season 2,"Do you think we would ever get the season 2 of hybe game caterers? I would love to see the groups interact with each other. Imagine the lineup-

Seventeen, TXT, Enhypen, Le sserafim, Illit, Boynextdoor, Fromis9, TWS, Jin (maybe), nwjns (maybe) etc

Season 1 was a huge success, it got 225 million views across 10 episodes, with highest episode having 58 million views. It would be a shame to not bring it back for a new season. 

I know right now, it seems very unlikely due to the whole nwjns situation, but I think it could be a good PR move for hybe, if people see all hybe groups interact with each other as it would be a huge distraction from everything that is happening.

If hybe could somehow convince nwjns(mhj) to participate, then it would also subside the whole mistreatment thing, and the narrative that hybe is trying to isolate newjeans. ",266,55
kpop_uncensored,1fqfq4e,2024-09-27 06:32:12,MHJ is really overestimating her Importance. ,"She keeps going on and on about her group has achieved in 2 years what boy groups have achieved in 5/6 or whatever and yet she’s not getting the same fandom support that those same boy groups have. 

 This is Enhypen’s sales for their July latest release for the first week : 2,344,749 copies sold. Belift is fully owned by Hybe and people were focused on their debt in the first half (cause of the cost of RUNEXT and cost of debuts) and didn’t focus on the fact that Hybe gets to keep all that sweet revenue from Enhypens activities, not to mention Enhypen have been touring like Crazy. 

This is TXT’s comeback from April’s release first week :  1,546,433 copies sold.

Both these groups generated more sales, and have been touring consistently!  

This is not to mention Japanese sales and releases.

Hybe is too big to fail, even if MHJ tries the public war path, SME and YGE literally has crimes in their past and they are still there.

BTS’ fandom alone was able to give birth to Hybe that it is today and that same fandom has been growing every year, that’s what MHJ thinks she has, yet she doesn’t. 

Maybe someone could show these stats and facts to Newjeans and MHJ but doubt it would do much. 

“Newjeans without Hybe could suffer greater losses than Hybe without Newjeans”

kpop_uncensored,1fi4y3o,2024-09-16 15:41:39,overworked enhypen ,"i’d just like to rant rq and some of yall might understand this differently than what i intended to convey, but as a fan, i don’t want to ever disrespect enhypen’s decisions to keep going and force them to something they don’t want to do and with the trending tags n sht, theres no way they don’t know about our concerns & its clear that the members’ also have the power to add schedules (e.g. fate+ in jakarta, its been said its the members decision to add the stop)

im not obv defending that shit company or blaming the members but i guess im trying to see it on the members’ perspectives and feelings as well.. cause let’s be real here, their fear of fans leaving them are not purely bc that company & some fans brainwashed them to thinking we’re gonna leave or are leaving but being a celebrity/artists, they know fans can’t stay forever (they come and go) they know that fans can leave not just bc they don’t like them anymore but also bc they know their fans also have lives outside of being a fan and can outgrew them.. part of their job is to literally make the fans stay or else they would lose their careers and i think thats one of the reasons why they work so passionately and couldn’t stop working.. kpop industry is so competitive esp. nowadays and they know that

Being with them and knowing them as artists for 4 years let me knew who they are, they are the type of people that have a lot of love to give and continues to give the fans entertainment and music. Obviously at the end of the day, belift have the full decision to give them a break, seeing as their artists are suffering (with injuries, colds, even to the point where they have to get IVs and drink lots of vitamins just to survive the schedule). The members also have mentioned they haven’t gotten the time for a vacation and they want one, being open about it ever since 2022. Belift is just so bad at managing their schedules, they could literally have these schedules with proper scheduling.. Their schedules are mentally and physically draining, and belift doesn’t know how to manage it properly.

But what I am trying to say, cause I have seen fans talking about this on x and some of them cause are so adamant to not attend their concert which is completely reasonable BUT there’s also this thought that we are forcing them (enha) to ALWAYS listen and follow us.. I’m not gonna baby them and think they’re fragile little boys, all of them are adults now and have the autonomy to make decisions themselves.. They know their body the best, the upcoming tour is for sure talked about with them and they probably want it as well.. I have spoken and posted tags and all that about how they need rest, but i guess now it came to the point where i feel like there’s nothing we can do as fans bc nothings happening, the concerts are going to push through or else consequences will happen (just like the japan stops, once an artist cancel their concert other than the reason of a natural disaster then they are out for good).. 

I just don’t know how to feel as a fan bc i want them to rest but at the same time i don’t want to force them to rest just bc we want them to.. im sorry but fans are not always right nor know any better.. and i don’t want them to ever think, we have left them bc we are boycotting the concert… im just imagining what it’ll be like to have a concert and all of a sudden have fans not show up.. its heartbreaking.. preparing for the tour with the thought of showing it to the fans but realizing no one’s coming? that shit will hurt them.. 

i hope this doesn’t get misunderstood, i want all the best for enhypen and i want them healthy and complete.. they are humans before they are artists, i just don’t know what to feel thats all",15,6
kpop_uncensored,1fhlvdd,2024-09-15 22:08:39,Enhypen seems to be doing good,"Enhypen despite their label overworking them with little to no marketing for them and always using them as a source to rake easy money from touring all the time. I am surprised that they are getting a lot of fans despite no promotions aside from the tours.Their songs are mostly so good due to which their Spotify streams are very high.And I tagged along with a friend of mine to their concert and I was so amazed with their performance.Despite their tough choreography they performs real good.Maybe it’s cause they toured and went to many different festivals they are so good at hyping the audiences.And they r ambassadors to Prada,though I have seen many grps or idols being ambassadors to many different brands i have seen very little efforts from the brand but for Enhypen the brands sends them birthday wishes and gifts every time,congratulating them on different occasions with gifts and the many times they have done photoshoots for magazines like vogue,dazed,GQ and many more and every time they are wearing Prada.There are so many other brands like Bulgari, Pomellato, tamburins, gentle monster, creed for perfume, human made 
,hince and Tiffany and co to which Jake and sunghoon are friends of house or something, they are invited to these various events many times and the way the staffs of these brands adore them and praises them is so amazing and awesome,the stafffs even watches Weverse lives  of the members and post abut them and even goes to their concerts.Tiffany and co also makes jakehoon to various photoshoots with different magazines. For real the brands seems to like Enhypen very much. The grp itself is quite introverted and never goes out the way just to please the audiences which I find unique and interesting for an idol grp. Anyways am very invested and in awe with this group nowadays I hope and pray for them to grow bigger and better!!!!!",24,5

kpop_uncensored,1fgkm2s,2024-09-14 14:09:53,complicated thoughts on that livestream we've all seen by now,"Before I start my thoughts on the video, I feel like I should say this isn't here to bash newjeans but I also don't think anyone is absolved from criticism or accountability so I will be giving that. 

The very first thing that stood out to me was the claim that Ador staff weren't aware of the live and will be surprised but KBS interviewed MHJ reps who warned them not go through with it? So people did know. And according to the reps, NewJeans wanted it to be a scheduled conference but when advised against it did a YouTube livestream. The scripts make sense now. If you're going to have a scheduled conference, you should be prepared. In terms of HYBE not allowing that conference, yeah, I understand why. A lot of their livestream was meant to deliver their ultimatum of wanting Heejin back which is never going to happen because she tried to have a company takeover. Businesses don't like that. 

It starts with them talking about personal records from before debut leaked. One, no one has found evidence of their medical records being leaked. Two, their trainee videos weren't leaked. I don't know if a lot of people on this thread have auditioned for companies before, were trainees, or were idols but as someone who has those contracts state they have permission to use all video and footage you give them for up to a period of time even if you aren't in their company. Usually the time period is 1-3 years. Source Music was within their right to post whatever trainee videos they wanted because of that contract agreement. When I say contract, even the audition form has this clause at the bottom. 

Can it be super awkward and not the most comfortable thing to have to see those videos public? Yes. I don't doubt that. But the language being used is very charged and is incorrect because they know that people will immediately latch on emotionally to them saying personal records leaked. Unless they and their parents didn't read the part in the contract that states the consent to your likeness but that would also be a problem. 

As to why Source posted the videos? To show that they weren't brought in by MHJ but were Source trainees and to also show that MHJ didn't come up with NewJean's debut. Well, this argument is two fold: 

1. If people are claiming that heels dance practice was before MHJ got to Source and that's why the inappropriate choreo is all by Source then that means Attention was created before MHJ got there. So she wasn't the creative genius behind their debut that she tries to paint herself out to be. (Never mind the entire thing is literally just Korean TLC so I don't see how she thinks she's so innovative). 

2. If she was there for Attention then she was there for the heels choreo. So if you still think it's inappropriate then she would be responsible as well. 

Now, as a dancer. It's pretty normal for girls (and boys nowadays) to start learning heel choreography in middle school. Usually in high school, you start wearing heels for musical characters but also it's a skill for when you are an adult. If you watch almost any heel dance video on YouTube, you will see a younger kid there if the video is in a classroom setting. Now, should they ever be in a performance on stage like that? No. That would be absolutely inappropriate behavior. But in class or training isn't a problem. Also, to whoever is saying they were dressed sexually. She was in leggings! Don't be weird. 

And you guys weren't dogging Cookie when it came out so don't expect me to think you mean it this time. Anyway... 

Hani speaking about the manager thing was odd. She admits to overhearing and not knowing the context. The girls can't seem to figure out why this happened but that's a little hard for me to believe. MHJ publicly dogged ILL-IT, Le Sserafim, BTS, and more groups. HYBE revealed it was ILL-IT's manager so I'm going to speaking in regards to them. The staff at ADOR posted on social media about ILL-IT supposed plagiarism. Other company staff (highly inappropriate btw) dogged these girls. And then NewJeans supported their CEO and staff despite these actions. It makes perfect sense the manager said to ignore them. 

But also, maybe one of the girls wanted to confront Hani and the manager was saying ignore her. We don't know because she doesn't fully know. But, I'm just saying, if all that happened to me and my members then I would want to confront the person and my manager would've told me to drop it and ignore them instead of causing problems. 

A big thing on the new Ador CEO. She's from HR. She's doing everything by the book which is why without evidence she couldn't do anything for Hani because the accusation was Hani being ignored. That's not a workplace violation, it's just petty and annoying coworker beef. Which I have to say isn't the mistreatment everyone wants to claim it is. It's not mistreatment and it's not bullying to have a coworker not want to mess with you. They don't like you. That happens sometimes but especially in entertainment. 

I think it's weird that their fans and the general public act like they can't be successful without MHJ. The girls thinking that makes sense because she's a groomer and has established an unhealthy codependent relationship with them. But how are the fans falling that? MHJ's entire concept was let me rip off TLC because Y2K is trending right now and act like I'm a genius. I promise you another creative director in kpop would have come up with that. To me, it screams a lack of faith in their own talent if fans think they need a single producer to make good music with a good concept. Also she doesn't even produce their music or write any of their lyrics so they definitely would have been fine without her because all that music is coming from other people. 

The stop harassing our CEO was wild. 

All in all, the livestream was a mess. I know it worked in their favor in terms of garnering public sympathy but their careers are now up in the air. I much rather have the stability of my job than public empathy. I think it's strange as hell that MHJ has her employees riding so hard for their boss. Sure, artists are the product of these companies but they are still employees. When your two bosses are fighting, you stay out of it unless you're subpoenaed by the court. They'll be fine. Like rich conglomerate HYBE versus rich CEO MHJ, that was only their business. She should have never dragged NewJeans into it like this. 

However, even if the girls can't see their own situation as grooming (which can be very hard for victims to do), they know what bullying of others looks like. They put themselves out there to support someone after she was publicly bullying other groups. That is something to be held accountable for. 

  
Also, in terms of Jungkook. There seems to be a weird narrative that because he supports newjeans (as is his right) because he feels that young artists shouldn't be dragged into disputes, that all of army must follow him. Um... that's cult-like behavior. You don't blindly agree with someone or shut up and agree with them because they are your fav or you're in their fandom. He is allowed an opinion as are his fans. Those comments were just weird to see. 

Do I think HYBE will fire them? It depends. If the point was to get fired without having to pay that termination fee then it's not happening. They'll be kept and put on indefinite hiatus until that contract dries up. If they can still be fired but have to pay then maybe. At the end of the day, HYBE is a conglomerate. Conglomerates are solely focused on business. That's why their artists have artistic teams to advocate for them to the conglomerate. Which is what HYBE is trying to have happen in Ador now. It was a mistake for them to ever allow the artist team and the business team to be the same. That's how this mess started. 

I also think it's weird how whenever a group is doing well, everyone is glad for the HYBE autonomy policy but whenever they are doing bad then it's all HYBE's fault. Pick a struggle. HYBE can't be involved and uninvolved at the same time. 

NewJeans aren't the only group HYBE doesn't care about. They don't care about any groups because it isn't their job to care. That's the job of the individual company management teams who were hired for that very reason. HYBE is nothing but a corporation. It's heartless but the truth. They pay people to have the artists' wellbeing in mind and to either report back to the HYBE board or argue with the board or do whatever they need to do and HYBE will listen but HYBE themselves aren't doing that. So yeah, they don't care about newjeans because they don't care emotionally for any group. 

These subsidiaries run themselves. HYBE is a glorified bank/investor and the newspaper. Enhypen or TXT being overworked would be BigHit and Belift's fault. Fromis9 lack of comebacks would be Pledis' fault. GFRIEND disbandment would be Source's fault. 

At the same time, GFRIEND's amazing last album was all a credit to Source. Seventeen's amazing tour and Fromis9 banger comeback is all a credit to Pledis. Enhypen's amazing concepts are all Belift. And TXT's amazing tour is all BigHit. As the parent company, of course HYBE is going to make all the announcements regarding each group but they aren't running the day to day or even month to month of each group. If they did then there would be no need for subsidiaries. 

Finally, when people are criticizing MHJ or even newjeans stop calling it misogyny. I'm so sick of this narrative that we just hate women because we're pointing out an actual problem. Never mind the fact that most of us are women criticizing another woman. Women are capable of doing wrong as well. Min Heejin has photos of a topless and UNDERAGE Brooke Shields in her house. That's weird as hell. It isn't misogyny to say ""that's sus behavior, you probably shouldn't be around children you creep."" 

  
TLDR; this is probably a good case for why minors shouldn't debut. the livestream was a mess. hybe is just a standard conglomerate not the evil entity people want it to be. stop saying misogyny every time someone criticizes a woman. and where the hell are any lawyers in this whole shebang? ",5,2
kpop_uncensored,1fbbeoi,2024-09-07 18:49:00,Defending sasaengs doesn't make you empathetic,"I came across this comment on the recent kpop junkee video. They were commenting on the recent Enhypen Sasaengs. When people called them out, op said that those people lack understanding and empathy. If you feel sorry for sasaengs, you are an enabler.

kpop_uncensored,1f9gpdl,2024-09-05 09:34:48,Sasaengs are actually insane,"A few hours ago, an article was released about ENHYPEN and their sasaengs

What was in the article was this:

[Exclusive] 'Sasaeng ""Fans"" Have Crossed the Line'... ENHYPEN Suffers from Flight Information Leak

• It was discovered that sasaengs had illegally obtained their flight information, signed up to the airline without permission, and assigned seats arbitrarily.
• Moreover, these sasaengs deliberately blocked seat changes to place the members in their desired seats.
• It appears that these extreme sasaengs aimed to seat near the artists during the flight, either to tag along with them or to take unauthorized photos.
• During their return from their schedule in China, ENHYPEN attempted to change their flight and assign seats for the new return flight, but some members were unable to assign their seats. 
• As a result, ENHYPEN had to verify their identity at the airport to change their seats. The exposure of flight information directly caused harm to the artists.



This is actually insane, it was discovered the sasaengs used Enhypens personal information (passport number, full name) 

ENHYPEN consulted the airline and found that someone had already registered as a member using some of the members’ personal information. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the contact information was registered as a Chinese number and that the seat selection was intentionally blocked. Thus, ENHYPEN had to change seats after verifying their identity at the airport.


How did they even get their passport numbers??? 

Belift already released a statement that they will make sure to protect them, but this has been going on for so long....

kpop_uncensored,1f6yz6q,2024-09-02 07:24:44,enhypen would have more to gain than lose if they were to fully embrace having female leads,"warning: a lotta yapping ahead

based on the news headlines & social media posts I came across when Bite Me was released, it seemed to me that enhypen received worldwide attention mainly for performing a ""mature"" routine with women. gasp!

while a large number of engenes were against enha partnering up with female dancers, I saw far more people — fans, casual listeners, & k-pop enthusiasts alike — commend enhypen, & come to their defense.

considering that both Manifesto, the comeback that preceded Dark Blood; & Bite Me, enha's first drop after 10 months, got backlash, I wouldn't have expected the latter to boost enha's popularity in the good way it did.

I feel like if they involved & interacted more with female actors whenever it'd be necessary for their storyline/concept, enha being seen with the opposite sex won't get them crucified. fans would instead, learn to desensitize, & girl-boy sightings would become normal like it should be.

in an industry that caters to & heavily depends on fans' delulu-ness to steer clear of controversy, what enha did may have been unacceptable to engenes (lmao how could they!!!!! please), but it gave them a glimpse of new opportunities. they could collab with more artists, venture into acting & playing love interest roles if they wanted, & decline uh... questionable requests from fans without having to worry about boycotts, hate trains, & defamation.

—

plus, just an afterthought that isn't exactly related to enhypen & girls: the boys have to constantly feed many engenes' need for fan service & content, especially given their whole boyfriend image. if there were some kind of intervention that reminds people that they're idols & not possible romantic partners, enha could actually take long breaks while still maintaining a solid fanbase, but I digress.",34,17

kpop_uncensored,1ep1k0m,2024-08-10 21:42:52,I don't like 'XO' by Enhypen ,Literally every fucking engene made me think I was crazy for some reason ,203,217
kpop_uncensored,1es6t8z,2024-08-14 18:57:03,Engenes need actual help and it needs to be talked about.,"Hey so I'm not necessarily a fan on Enhypen but I can't help but notice that their stans are actually insane. You'd normally assume it would be only antis or mostly antis at least, that hate on the members for stupid things, but from what I've seen it's almost always ""engenes"". 

I have a couple examples, most of these, mind you are absolutely ridiculous but Enhypen unfortunately were dragged through the mud for. And tbf I understand that all kpop idols are bound to get hate at some point in there career due to scandals and what not. But these boys simply breathe too loud and get attacked like crazy.

1. Ni-ki blowing out candles on a live. I'm sure we all know this one because of the dramatic amount of hate he got FOR BLOWING OUT A CANDLE ?? I was so confused when I first saw this [clip](https://youtu.be/c2T0SoqAfHE?feature=shared) because it looked normal, like just a couple of boys messing around. And I've heard from a couple normal engenes that it wasn't even Sunoo's birthday or anything so I don't understand why the fandom made it such a big deal. He got hate as if he had been I  a huge scandal or something when all he did was blow a fricking candle with his hands.

2. Sunghoon (I think thats his name im not sure) when he forgot the name of a girl from Leserrafim (Eunchae I think) during the hybe family picnic. And Engenes and Leserrafims fans were so pissed, even though I'm sure the girl didn't even mind.

3. This one is a bit recent and it's not as big as the others but I figured I should add something that happened recently to prove my point that engenes haven't really changed. Basically the boys were on stage [playing with water](https://youtube.com/shorts/_lQblSrAMeI?feature=shared) and splashing eachother, and it looked like they were having fun. I kid you not my whole FYP was filled with videos like ""Enhypen ganging up on Sunoo"", ""Poor Sunoo has to deal with mean members"" etc. And again, it was always posted from Enhypen fan pages which made no sense to me.

Aren't stans supposed to like their idols, cause to me it feels like engenes (not all but a very big chunk) don't even like the group, like at all. Their always there to nitpick everything each member does and if they don't like it they'll riot. Then they'll blame the company for not protecting the idols when it's literally the fans that pay for concerts and fan meets that act like this. What's the company supposed to do? Ban fan meets?

Again I will say that I'm not a fan of enhypen, but I do enjoy most of their music as a casual listener, but I feel the main reason I never really got into them was because of their fandom, and to anyone who'll go on about how 'I shouldn't let a bad fandom keep me away from good groups', I want to stress that at some point I'd leave eventually anyways because I'd just be so sick of how annoying most fans can be. Stans are a really big part of what groups I get into because I don't think anyone wants to be dealing with 9 year old mindsets on a daily basis or everytime the group is mentioned.

I'm sure there are many more examples but again I'm not a Stan and I don't know much about the members, if you want to mention other fandoms that are similar go ahead. But keep it civil obviously.

Edit: quite a number of people are saying that my examples don't represent Enhypen stans as a whole and are only about Sunoo solo stans, which I do apologise for. I've compiled a couple more examples that do for the right topic (I didn't know of the existence of akgaes when writing my post but I've done some reasearch), I'm not trying to push the agenda that all the fans are bad, but I want some of you to understand that it really isn't just solo stans or just antis, a big number of twt posts, insta posts and tiktoks are from literal engenes. 

4. 'Bite Me' female dancers. (This one was mentioned in the comments and I couldn't believe I forgot to include it) I did do some research so that I wouldn't be talking about this topic completely clueless, but as far as I know Enhypen had female dancers for their 'Bite Me' choreo which many fans did not like, so many that they managed to send trucks to the hybe building rioting against it. Now I'm not sure if this was a result of these protests but shortly after, 'Bite Me' got a new choreo that didn't feature any backup dancers at all. Once this choreo was released there were videos of engenes saying the preferred the female dancer version, which didn't make sense to me at all because how do you hate it enough to send fricking trucks out, then the company goes out and changes it and you go off on how ""this choreo looks so bland"", ""the female dancers carried this comeback"".

5. The content disappointed fans feel after every comeback. Stans will hype up a comeback from Enhypen until the whole world hears about it, which is a good thing right? But once the album is out, you get all these twts on how they were disappointed because maybe ""The mv was bad"" or ""I dont like this concept they should stick to this *insert edgy dark concept*""

6. I heard this one in the comments and was baffled. Apparently there was a scandal of some sort where people were trying to figure out if Heesung had said the n-word before, and obviously there's going to be that group of fans that will protect their favourites from everything, but the way they went about it was foul and disgusting. They went onto weverse and started posting black people being lynched and beaten up and saying black engenes should leave the fandom. Meanwhile on twitter they trended ""protect enhypen"" and started messing up the searches of other idols by saying stuff like soobin n-word, jungkook n-word, san n-word, hyunjin n-word etc. (I'm including this users comment in my post directly because it's been down voted and is very low, even though I believe it should really be spoken about.) 

I'm sorry but that behavior is crazy, whether they're fans are kids or not wtf, who posting things like that about other human beings? I feel as though these fans are just hateful people in general which isn't really okay, and it doesn't sit right with me that actual engenes don't speak more on the matter but just take it as ""oh well there are people like this in every fandom, we'll just have to deal with them"". I don't this you understand but to non-stans like me it has completely ruined the reputation of your fandom, it isn't just something to ""deal with"". Engenes really need a fandom cleanse, do these people even like the boys?",139,81
kpop_uncensored,1et3m0k,2024-08-15 21:08:23,Ava max VS Engenes," I am SO annoyed at engenes rn, they are INSUFFERABLE OH MY GOD

 Ava Max posted a tweet saying: “Well, fun fact, this was a song originally made for me” under an XO related tweet. Engenes went CRAZYYYYY about it hating her horribly and lets not even talk about twt engenes. Everyone is telling her how horrible her part is and she even deleted the tweet because of so much hate. 

 Why, all i ask? I dont even listen to her NOR support her, but this is getting out of hand. 

 It’s common for artists to pass on songs to other artists??? Like “Red flavor” by RV, it was originally for Little Mix, or “Euphoria” by JK, it was originally for Justin Bieber. 

 What’s wrong with her being the first artist getting this song and her agency passing it down to others? She meant no harm with her tweet, there’s NO negativity in it, NOTHING.

 Her part is not even that bad??? Yall just cant take seeing enhypen sing with a female artist…  Seeing everyone saying “who is ava max” is just insane tbh (and they 100% know her, just want to hate on her)

 Sorry for a rage post like this, it’s just so insufferable to me to not speak about it ^^

kpop_uncensored,1egsvlg,2024-07-31 19:22:28,ENHYPEN are fighting each other over a cat,"ENHYPEN fighting over pussy. Real [news](https://youtu.be/yjxLMzeV76Q?si=kVZejEHAfzls2OIV).

Also, no one is truly is injured. Why? This my friends I can answer by briefly explaining how [Brought The Heat Back MV](https://youtu.be/yjxLMzeV76Q?si=8JV4ZGITx4SSlS5g) is the best thing that happened since IT came out and people decided it was a good idea to do more horror sequences and remakes and spit on Kubrick by releasing Doctor Sleep.

Now, you might wonder what Stephen King has to do with this? Hold tight people who were confused over the cat. Two words. Pet. Sematary. Go watch it, it’s peak classic horror. Basically, the whole MV is a reference to the movie (or book). 

The story is about a family who just moved to this seemingly dangerous road and has a pet cemetery on their new land. The catch is that everything that gets buried in that cemetery comes back to life, albeit a bit… off (really, murderous and undead). So, at some point their cat gets ran over (Heeseung running Sunoo over with the car do you see it?) and they decide it’s a good idea to try and test the cemetery out. Of course, in the end, >!everyone ends up dead lol!<. 

All of this is such a good combination with vampires because they can’t really die lol. So they’re going at each other for the cat and keep coming back, nailing each other in coffins, throwing it in each others heads, running each other into walls with the black cat (hello Poe’s The Black Cat, great bumping into you) and cornering each other on red elevators and walk in freezers (YES! to The Shining references). 

Better yet: it’s camp. (Thus the flying fish lmao). It’s a fun little silly rendition of immortal vampires looney tooning each other over a cat. Over pussy.

So many gems btw, Sunghoon driving a “Real men love cats” (Real men love what? Pussy) car (none of them can drive why are they always driving lmfao), when he’s number one Jungwon brainwasher, Jake’s bleached eyebrows (damn what a face hats off to Mrs. Sim), the red eyes bridge with clawssss, JUNGWON’S ARMSSSSS (WHAAAAAT), Ni-ki not being able to hold his laugh when Heeseung is shutting him in a closet. THE FLYING FISH. THE CHOREO YESSS SHAKE THOSE HIPSSSSS. 

AND THE SOOOOOOOONG. Drunk-Dazed your legacy will be passed on, we have a new ~~bitch~~ baddie in town (see what I did there?)! Brought The Heat Back is so good. I’m so happy they’re promoting it, it’s my favourite b-side alongside Moonstruck.

I’m pretty new to kpop it’s been less than a year and I need your help building my playlist! I feel like there’s so much good music I’m missing out on so I figured I’d ask you all. 

For an idea of my taste Iooooovvee Pop/R&B style music. Sensual, light sounds, similar to ballads & lullabies (not children’s music just softer sounds). I also like music for adults aka adult themes.  lmao please none of Kidz Bop sounding tunes. It’s cute and all just not for me. I’m also open to any non Kpop recommendations!! 

Some Kpop examples: 

Peaches - Kai 

Lucifer - Enhypen 

3D - JK & Jack Harlow

All I wanna do - Jay Park 

Like That - Baby Monster 

Mixed up - Enhypen 

Friends - V 

Who - Jimin  

On the Street - J hope & J Cole 

Some non Kpop examples: 

Clouded - Brent Fiyaz 

Act ii: date @ 8 - 4batz & Drake 

Doves in the wind - SZA & Kendrick 

Doin’ Time - Lana Del Rey 

Stormy - Nissy & SKY-HI (honorable Jpop mention) 

F**k the World (Summer in London) - Brent Fiyaz 


Hopefully those are enough songs for you guys to catch my vibes and help me expand my playlists!!! 

Thanks bunch to anyone who takes the time to comment. 😌❤️

This also applies to music broadcast like inkigayo/music bank, send-offs, and concerts. Theyre always part of every event the group does and post it. In enhypens world tour, some fans seem to go to all the locations of the tour.

kpop_uncensored,1egifob,2024-07-31 11:00:43,Hoshi is NOT the Best Dancer in SVT. Dino is. ,"I know this is very ""controversial"" coz Carats seem to have created this narrative. And I would like to present my argument as a dancer who has been learning dance for the past 10yrs. I have always found Dino's dancing very attractive out of all of SVT and I just thought that it was a personal preference but then I saw a lot of Carats yapping about this so I decided to actually put thought and analyse their dancing skills with help from my other dancer friends who basically know nothing abt kpop. These are my opinions along with a few other opinions from my friends: 

	1. Dino has more years of professional training than Hoshi. He learnt dancing from his father who is a professional dancer since he was very young. Hoshi started professionally learning when he became a pledis trainee which is 4 yrs. before debut. He was in a dance club before that in school but that doesn’t exactly equate to professional training. I got to say Hoshi definitely has natural talent for dancing. 
	
	2. Dino has better technique than Hoshi. There are so many things like angles, body lines, textures, dynamics, fluidity, Rhythm, Flow, Power, Consistency, Agility, Execution, Versatility, Isolations, facial expressions, even ability to freestyle, etc that I took into consideration before coming to that conclusion.
	
	3. They are similar in skills with a lot of these things but there are some things like Isolations, Consistency in facial expressions and mainly sense of dynamics where I see Hoshi is behind Dino.
	
	4. Sense of Dynamics is something that is very important for a dancer. That is what helps you communicate what you are feeling to the audience. In a routine, some steps must be executed powerfully, some light and smooth, some sharp, etc. this differs with songs and even steps. Hoshi struggles with this. He has this tendency to do most moves with the same energy. He doesn’t punctuate steps a lot. This absolutely takes away from his dance. You cannot actually notice his issue with dynamics a lot in boy group choreos because they are generally power based. Girl groups on the other hand. When he did the Easy challenge with Lesserafim. You could tell he used more power than meant for the choreo. The choreo is supposed to look ""easy"" like the dance should look like not much effort was put into it. But if you take a challenge he did with Enhypen you can that’s he is so good coz that choreo shows all his pluse points.
	5. Also Consistency with energy and facial expressions. There are places he uses too much power and then gets tired by the second half of the song. Which translates directly to his face where the facial expressions become minimal. Dino unlike Hoshi has constant facial expressions from start to finish and doesn’t get tired or atleast doesn’t look like it.
	6. I know a lot of people are gonna give this argument that he is the performance unit leader then it must mean he is the best one in the pfu. Which doesn't make sense to me coz the Leader positions don't correlate with their skills in rap or vocal or dance. it has more to do with who leads the members the best. Woozi is the vocal unit leader doesn't mean he is the best in Vocals, Seungkwan and DK are. 
	I have no ill intentions towards Hoshi or anyone in SVT, this is just me being confused as to who created this narrative when its clearly wrong.

kpop_uncensored,1e8oh10,2024-07-21 17:10:52,I’m so impressed by Stray Kids,"As a quick disclaimer, I’ve been listening to Stray Kids casually since when I became a kpop fan in 2021 but I’m not a Stay. If I get any facts wrong I’m open to correction from Stays. 

Before i heard ATE, i had no expectations. Stray Kids songs are usually fun but they don’t always land for me, but I like them enough to tune in every comeback because the effort the members put into it is usually obvious. **The reason I’m writing this is because I’ve noticed how Stray Kids has continued to improve with every comeback. The key area of improvement IMO is in their group identity**. 

I feel JYP in general is very good at making groups with very distinct group identities within the company - nobody will ever confuse Twice with Itzy or Itzy with NMIXX, or Stray Kids with GOT7 or Nexz. BUT, **i think the biggest reason Stray Kids stands out is because of the members themselves**.

The group actually self-produces most of their music, practically every member has at least one attribute that is unique to them or that they’re known for, and a lot of Stray Kids’ collaborations seem to form organically from the members’ own interests rather than a purely corporate relationship. 

As a 6 year old group, there’s a chance for them to sort of plateau in popularity and skill because that’s what happens with many groups around this time, but what is instead happening to Skz is that with literally every comeback, they (1) sound better (in rap skill and vocals), (2) they function more cohesively as a group, (3) they appear to be managed by JYP in a way that doesn’t sully their group’s identity. 

Stray Kids has a reputation of making ‘noise music’ but IMO they are one of the groups that makes *good* noise music. It’s not always my taste but I can sense the ambition of 3racha’s productions when I listen to some of their songs. The latest example of this is Chk Chk Boom which has become the song of my summer. 

[Chk Chk Boom](https://youtu.be/T17AR8cVmto?si=xJQzZD9oeta80taL) has reggaeton influences but it doesn’t sound derivative and it feels cohesive with Stray Kids’ musical style and group identity. It doesn’t feel like they copy-pasted a trendy sound that has no relationship with their sound style, but instead they made it their own. The fact the members are involved in that decision makes it all the more impressive to me. The rest of the ATE album also shows their versatility with genres in a way that’s again cohesive with their overall sound.

All this to say, I don’t currently stan Stray Kids but this comeback has impressed me so much I’ve started digging more into the group. All the groups I currently stan: BTS, ENHYPEN, and NewJeans - are groups that appeal to me because of their distinct group and sound identities, among other reasons. Seeing Stray Kids continue to mature as a group without losing their group identity and even building on it, is massively impressive. 

I wish them all the luck. ",287,62

I was rolling into my fyp and I saw 3 videos saying that ENHYPEN is Heeseung feat. ENHYPEN. I know that Heeseung usually has a lot of lines and attention but the other members have too! In the MV’s all of them are wonderful, everyone get his part in the song! Even Heeseung has more lines that doesn’t mean that he’s “feat. ENHYPEN”

I understand that the line distribution is not always fair but that doesn’t mean that you can call the group “member feat. Group”!

And the idols are not responsible for nothing! (Most of the time). So it’s Hybe/Be:lift that does that bad line distribution, it’s not the members fault!

kpop_uncensored,1e391b4,2024-07-14 20:16:10,Kpop debut/survival show recommendations ,"As stated in the title, I'm looking for ANY debut show recommendations.

I know someone already posted something similar recently asking about which groups y'all stanned after watching survival shows, but a lot of y'all just commented the names of groups and not the shows they were on. I didn't wanna reply to each comment and ask what shows each of them were on, so I just decided to make my own post 🙈

The first show I watched was Boys Planet, which was a while after ZB1 debuted but they were still really new at the time. Honestly, I like them as a group, but I feel like most of their songs aren't for me... (Please no hate TT)

The show was really good though, and the performances even more so. I just had to save some of the songs to my playlist too lol Jelly Pop, Over Me and Supercharger are my faves from the show.

Currently, I'm on the last episode of I-Land with Enhypen. I've loved that group and their songs for a long time, so it was really interesting seeing how they started and how their personalities grew as the show progressed. There were so many tear-jerking and shocking moments in the show (gosh, the global rankings lol) that really makes me feel more appreciative of the hard work they put in as group, as well as individuals. As well as those who didn't get to debut from the show.

I was honestly surprised that Ni-Ki was so good at dancing way before he even debuted. And poor Jay lol It was funny afterwards, but the way he was ignored (around the middle of the show) and wasn't even considered when they had to distribute parts, it was really sad. 

But anyway, any suggestions on what to watch next? Preferably shows before 2020 or so?  

Atm, I'm not really interested in the new groups who recently debuted. I'm mostly looking for groups that's been around for like 3 or 4 years +, even if some of them have already disbanded by now.

I've also wondered if groups like MONSTA X, Pentagon, Oneus, etc (not hyped up enough groups these days) debuted from shows. I know there are groups out there who were just formed but didn't go through the whole process of having to debut through a show. It's just fascinating.

Please do drop your recommendations in the comments, as well as which guy/girl groups debuted from those shows in (brackets/parentheses). I'd really appreciate it :)

Also, you're welcome to leave suggestions on group survival shows (of any year) such as Kingdom etc. I haven't gotten around to watch those, but I think I did watch Road to Kingdom, though.

But anywaysss....

One of the Korean producers I was looking into was El Capitxn. Honestly this is why I made this post because looking into him, he is honestly crazy impressive. (Suprised I'm just finding him now)

He is former member of HISTORY (as Yi-jeong born '93). An iconic 3rd gen beast group who got cut too early. I am not sure about other idol producers, but this guy must be up there as one of the most prolific idol producers, in terms of catalogue and writing for other artists. Hense the title 'Kpop maker'. I wanna know more about the producers who are writing for like 10+ groups, the artists behind the scenes. This way, you can discover similar songs you like more easily. \[Not like teddy, yg, jyp etc. that mainly produce for their label and already generally known.\]

-Armys probably know him as he became a big hit producer. He produces a lot outside bighit, and now he has his own production group (Vendors) upon further research they are everywhere.

Some of El Capitxn notable works -IU eight -BTS Dionysis, Make it Right, Mikrokosmos, Take Two -TXT Antiromantic, New rules, dear Sputnik TripleS Girls never die(currently trending), Generation

Artists he produced for (died a little making this)

1. RM - Right People Wrong Place (yeah even though it’s just the intro song I can’t get enough of it).
2. Itzy - Mr Vampire (Honestly this is the best they’ve ever sounded)
3. NewJeans - Right Now (Bossa Nova + drum & bass? Only NewJeans can deliver this potent mix just right)
4. NMIXX - Dash (They’ve found their sound and their next comeback will be explosive IMO)
5. ENHYPEN - Lucifer (Godly, haunting vocals).
6. NewJeans - How Sweet (Everytime the beat starts it hits. Also Lowkey their hardest and most fun choreo so far.)
7. Aespa - Mine (I feel like I’m in heaven listening to this)
8. P1Harmony - Killin It (They killed it with this one)
9. J-Hope - Neuron (Classic Hobi and it’s a real fave)
10. Ateez - Empty Box (I never knew Ateez could sound like this. Now I get the hype)
11. Le Sserafim - Easy (One of their best tts IMO)
12. H1-Key - Deeper (This group is genuinely underrated)
13. Young Posse - XXL (I love their sound and this song)
14. Xdinary Heroes - Boy Comics (sounds like the best parts of every shonen anime opening I’ve ever heard)
15. ILLIT - Magnetic (this song is a bop and the girls can sing. Everytime I hear Minju’s starting verse it feels like a treat)

kpop_uncensored,1dgnjoc,2024-06-15 19:53:30,Did you ever try to defend kpop groups/soloists that you are or were not into at all? ,"So the title is pretty much self explanatory, but allow me to develop more.

There are always fanwars in Kpop. And often time it brings out of proportion hate to groups or soloists. Defending its fav is kinda a given in Kpop (or almost any industry to be fair).   
Personnally it is rare for me to do it for my two ults because usually one fandom is very reactive(sometimes too much...) so it is rare that I have the time to say something, like at most I would put a like in a moderate raising posts (stays). The other one is usually on its own bubble (bellieve).   
I do like a lot of other groups for their music, voice tone, dance style or variety skills(but primarily for their voice/music). And I did share my thought when I felt something unfair is said about them.

However I did sometimes defend groups/soloists I am not fan of or don't really like when I thought the critics were too much or unfair. (I must say that usually when I don't like, I ignore or try to understand why so maybe I could go pass some biases and like them, but don't leave post that shame the ""hater""'s favourite groups).

So, I wanted to ask to bring light on more balanced behaviour. Did it ever happen to you? Like try to explain in a polite way why you don't really like the group. And what did you think was exaggerate criticisms or straight up hate.

I can start with some examples :

- Blackpink : I am still not the biggest fan of the group. Because I really don't like the concept and really few musics (for taste matter), because to me there are depth and pov of their portrayal that is lacking or missed opportunities (I can see why many love it though,And I know they have songs with depths. I am more talking of promoted songs).  They came back for born pink album they were so bashed. I have seen some horrendous mysogine posts that I reported. Some exagerration in their performances. Yes did some bad ones when they came back, and while I saw positive comments on their ""Gala des pièces jaunes"", I also saw some people say that is disastrous. When in fact, as someone who watched it through TV. It was awesome!

- Enhypen : Vampire theme are one I usually try to avoid as best as I can (I am a scaredy yes), and I wasn't too much a fan of how their voice were produced in their songs. However, when I saw the amount of hate minor(even in age is bad) Niki got for supposedly harrasing his co-member Sunoo, I was disappointed. If I remember correctly it came mostly from the fandom. It was a sad situation, because you could easily see as many clips were he is worried for Sunoo who isn't eating enough.

- Lesserafim/Illit: hot topic currently. Like Blackpink I am not a big fan of the concept for more or less similar reasons and also the music I am less fan. And yeah, I do think they tend to be  inconsistent with their vocal performances. However, I really really hate when people just straight up say they can't sing when they did have good performances/encores too. Moreover a lot of the critics didn't come from a good place, since it was complete mockery without thinking maybe there are some behind scene problem(specifically for one member who had instable voice while talking till recently). And I have a hard time to think the members are the main problem when they improved tremendously in dancing in a very short period of time (they did also vocally at a slower path for Kazuha, Eunchae and Sakura. Yes it is still inconsistent but it is getting there).  
  
Could you share your thoughts/experiences?  ",68,54
kpop_uncensored,1degisv,2024-06-12 22:22:05,Upcoming Comebacks you think are going to blow your socks off,"..so, not just comebacks you're anticipating, but the comebacks you think are going to be nuclear fire good amazing for you.

For me:

* **Le Sserafim:** The set up in the Easy trailer for their new Easy-Crazy-Hot trilogy was just too good. Easy era was a wild ride for those girls but that's the era that made me a fan of their music and their attitude. I have exactly zero doubts in my mind they are bringing nothing less than heat in Crazy. I expect them to break almost every record they've had so far and up the ante in the fearless spirit they've shown till now. Plus the dancing at least will be crazy (lool). I'm rooting for them.
* **NewJeans:** NJ has two upcoming comebacks - the Super-natural comeback middle/late June 2024, and their full album comeback in Q4 2024. I've noticed a pattern in how Ador paces music and seen they use single albums to pace the fans until a more full packaged release of music, \[recall Ditto/OMG single album before Get Up EP, now it's the How Sweet/Supernatural double singles albums before their 1st full album\]. To say I've been obsessed with How Sweet (on bass boost) is an understatement, but from the [teasers,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UagOXpNCc10) somehow Right Now might actually trump that song for me and the fact Ador is waiting this long to tease Super Natural is like a red flag in the best way for me. It's hard to believe that I didn't start really liking them until this past December, but in 6 months they've solidified their place as my fave gg so far. The odds are stacked against them in some ways with their upcoming releases, but I only hope for the best for them.
* **KARD:** I saw some fancams from their tour in Q1 and was surprised by the ENERGY because it's just four people on stage but they literally devoured??!? There was no fancy formations or gimmicks, just four people with mics working the stage. I don't usually jump in to say groups are underrated but this is one group that should really be making more noise. (This group and P1Harmony). I only followed KARD off and on last year but their stuff recently has me really excited for their upcoming comeback. I think they're one of the groups that does '21+ kpop' really well. 
* **ENHYPEN:** [Memorabilia (May 2024)](https://open.spotify.com/album/0OhJwEzXbK9Km6GQSPdmPU) is an album that if you've not heard it yet, you should stop what you're doing and listen to it. Their vocal evolution, especially Jay's and Ni-ki's, is so crystal audible in that album that everytime I listen it feels like a treat. Unlike most Enhypen albums though, this album unfortunately has one skip for me, but it's also an OST album for their webtoon and also has easily some of the best composed songs in their entire discography. Personal recs are Criminal Love, Lucifer, and Teeth. I know their upcoming album will be nuclear level good because they've been leveling up in every release since Dark Blood. Orange Blood had gems like Blind and Still Monster, and Memorabilia you just heard about.
* **ILLIT:** Another Hybe gg going through trial by fire recently. They only just debuted but I'm looking forward to their comeback for 2 reasons. (1) I liked their debut EP and want to see how they develop their sound and concept. I can't deny the similarities to NJ that I notice, but I realize that's partly also why I like them in the first place since they have a similar appeal in some ways.  **(2) I'm hoping we get introduced to their Summer Moon webtoon lore this time.** One reason I've gotten into ENHYPEN is their Dark Moon webtoon lore, and I think ILLIT can leverage their webtoon to differentiate themselves more meaningfully from other groups to establish their own identity. There's not a single doubt in my mind their next comeback will be phenomenal but in production quality, budget, and storyline themes so I'm excited.
* **BTS (Jin):** As the first member to enlist, Jin didn't have as much time as the other members to prepare solo stuff but even then he left us with the song he wrote with Coldplay. Now, he will probably drop his solo album and given [his prior solo songs (Moon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5H3g0UR7CI) could cover genres like Brit pop, Pop rock, Pop ballads, but I also want to see Jin try stuff like Techno, Reggae pop, and House. He could definitely pull it off lol. ",101,58
kpop_uncensored,1d6yc2b,2024-06-03 08:57:51,The way Enhypen TEETH is the alternate version of DRUNK-DAZED?? This song perfectly fits for party,,125,11
kpop_uncensored,1dctwbe,2024-06-10 21:16:45,Am I the only one who thinks the Belift Lab video isn't a big deal lol ,"Ok before anyone from either side jumps on me let me explain my thought process here.

Disclaimer before I start I guess, I'm an illit fan, though I don't care about Belift beyond their obvious connection to illit, and the fact that the girls' careers are tied to the company. I think the girls have gotten a completely absurd amount of hate, considering they debuted less than 3 months ago and haven't personally done a single ""problematic"" thing, in addition to being young and inexperienced in the industry. So like I am coming at this from this perspective.

I was initially very happy when I heard Belift is going after the ppl harassing illit (and enhypen, though I admit I don't know enough about this group, good for them), because as I said the volume of hate is absurd. THEN I found out about the video, and saw a lot of kpop stans shitting all over it, and complaining how it looks like it was made by stan twitter and not professionals, etc.

It did worry me at the start, I'm ngl. It felt like the illit hate and general controversy was dying down, and now the company drops this bombshell, mentions many different ggs, which has the potential to piss off their stans, and potentially re-ignites the hate against the girls. More than that, I thought it made the company look incompetent, as they had fallen for mhj's bait and are publically addressing the controversy in an embarassing way.

Then I stepped away from twitter for a few hours to do other things, and I realised I was blowing things a bit out of proportion. I guess this is the mythical ""touching grass"" everyone keeps going on about.

Basically, I do think the video was a misstep, but not the catastrophe twitter thinks it is, for the following reasons:

1. Belift is going after malicious people online. Let's be perfectly honest, kpop stans feel brave enough to post the things they do because they're anonymous and feel invincible. People who participated in previous hate trains will regret it and and people who would've otherwise participated in a hate train over the video will think twice about it. Hate online can never be 100% eliminated, but criminal charges can combat it. I would normally feel outraged about a big company going after random people online over their comments, but after seeing the type of bile kpop stans feel empowered to spew online I'm just like..... no, lol. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, you reap what you sow, etc.
2. Belift has already filed a criminal complaint against mhj, for defamation and obstruction of business iirc. I think it's really good they're getting a judge to eventually look over this, though obviously these things take time to go through the full process. I remember a leaked mhj text that said that the only thing that matters is the headlines, not the truth, in order to create a narrative. I don't like that lady, but I gotta admit she's right. I genuinely don't believe there was plagiarism in illit's debut, I think they're the type of group that has a whole lore, as was hinted at in the Magnetic MV and as I expect will be expanded on in the webtoon and following cbs. Regardless, whether you agree with me or not, plagiarism is something that needs to be proven via evidence, not ""vibes"". We gotta wait and see, but I don't think this situation will pan out in mhj's favour lol. If Belift is able to use this criminal complaint to spin their own narrative, then the video gets vindicated, even if its quality isn't actually good.
3. The girls aren't actually in the video lol. It's obviously about them, but they're not IN it, and the video itself isn't on the Hybe channel or on the illit channel. This is already a much cleaner separation between company and group than exists with ador and newjeans, who have become involved by filing statements in the injunction case and publically thanking mhj recently. Actually, despite all the controversy plaguing them since debut, illit, both individually and as a group, have been ranking pretty good in the monthly brand reputation rankings coming out of SK. Their EP has been selling very well, and we all know how viral Magnetic has become lol. I mean seriously, I like the song but I've heard it a gazillion times at this point. This goes back to my ""touching grass"" comment: I just don't think the GP cares about any of this lmao. We become so focused on fan wars and stan twitter and stan whatever that we forget that this stuff is barely a blip on the radar for most people. As long as the girls keep focused on promo activities, and as long as the next cb is good (you never know with kpop, but I don't think they're gonna fall off in just a few months lmao let's be real) then.......... their image is fine. Like they're not the first nor last group to have a big controversy. As long as the girls themselves keep their heads down and wait for it to eventually pass, it'll be fine.
4. I don't speak korean, so what I know about the video's contents is based on various posts summarising it, so it might not be 100% accurate. That being said, I think the reason kpop stans are reacting so negatively to the video is because it pulls the veil back and exposes a lot about how the industry actually works lol, which they're never going to be ready to hear. I don't think it's strange that they used fan clips and fan theories in the video, because I think the whole modern kpop industry is overly reliant on extreme fan investment and work to even function. The companies rely on fans to launch fan wars online to defend the artists, and they rely on them to build and promote narratives through their obsession. The video was ""cringey"" because it shows something that was just implied before. Similarly, kpop companies do in fact base their groups' entire concepts on easily marketable ideas, up to and including the idols' personalities in a lot of situations. The entire industry, since its inception decades ago, relies on reusing popular ideas and concepts, such as (in)famously recycling hip hop imagery, sounds, and dance moves from Black American culture for the ""cool"" factor. Kpop is not known for originality. Additionally, the kpop industry heavily sexualises its idols, markets them as products, not as people, and specifically uses the school kid aesthetic in a sexual manner as it markets them to their adult fans. It's very disgusting. But there's no point ignoring it, because that doesn't help the kids being exploited. In the case of newjeans, who were mentioned in the video as having a concept along the line of ""teenagers as objects of romance in the minds of adults"", I don't think this is something Belift mentioned to ""drag"" or ""insult"" newjeans. I think it's something significantly more sinister, which is that Belift were simply relaying the basic concept as it's understood within Hype and the industry. Here's a bunch of teenage girls, leaning into the teenage aesthetic, with the purpose of attracting adult fans. At the very least, it's creepy. Bunnies shouldn't demand Belift apologise, they should demand Ador protect the girls. The video ""explains"" how industry people think, which is in a predictably terrible way that shouldn't have seen the light of day lmao.

DAMN THAT WAS WAY LONGER THAN EXPECTED. But yeah I had a lot of thoughts about this situation in general, and I wanted to see what other people thought, in a long-form format, because no one on twitter is making intelligent converstation about this lol. And it's not just because of the character limit. I think the video was us hearing how kpop industry professionals actually think and talk about business, which is ""cringey"" because the way the industry is run is distasteful across the board. But I don't think it's going to cause some kind of long term storm. I guess it depends on Belift, Hybe, and Ador, and how they move forward from here.",16,25

kpop_uncensored,1cpevne,2024-05-11 12:58:26,"You Don't Have To Like Every Song Or Try and Convince Others Your ULTS Have ""No Skips"". ","I love music, everything from 40's big band, to underground punk, to K-Pop. One thing I don't understand and don't know if I ever will is the K-Pop community generally having to convince themselves and others that EVERY SONG their faves/ults release are good.
I have been ARMY for 8 years, and there are songs I don't think are that great! I'm not a fan of Burning Up (Fire), Inner Child is boring imo, I think I always skip Make It Right, and I've just never really enjoyed N.O.
It doesn't make the songs bad, maybe others like them! But I continuously see fans of groups trying to preach that their groups have ""no skips"" or ""can't make bad songs"", but that's just... not true? I can't think of any group where their entire discography is 100% perfection and I listen to every single song. 
If you enjoy every song from a group, genuinely, then that's great. But trying to get on a high horse about it is just... annoying. Like why <insert some group here> is changing the industry and then you listen to the song and it's lyricism and/or musicality is mid... 

To keep myself transparent, I stan a handful of groups: BTS, ENHYPEN, Catch The Young, and TXT. That's about it. For girl groups it's basically only LE SSERAFIM lol

I keep trying to stan NCT Dream and Stray Kids, but their discography's for me are a mix of bangers and songs with no real meaning or impact other than being catchy OR they found a formula that works and their songs sound similar- not the same, but similar. Which if you enjoy is perfectly fine! I still like songs by both groups, but you don't need to be so upset when I say I don't like certain songs. It's not a slight against your group... as you can see by my earlier comment, there's even songs by my Ults- BTS- that I don't necessarily like. 
Same goes for my other groups- I didn't love Orange Blood from Enhypen, in fact it was the first time I was actively skipping multiple songs by Enhypen. 
If anyone out there wants to share songs by their ults they don't like, please do! We should NORMALIZE ""negative"" opinions in K-Pop, even with our faves. 

Tldr; You don't have to love every song your faves release for you to be a fan.

kpop_uncensored,1cr4cqk,2024-05-13 19:00:59,Mobbing Idols ,"I find it so annoying and selfish when i watch videos of “fans” mobbing idols at the airport or a mall or at a restaurant. Showing up and rushing to idols when they’re just trying to get to their hotel, or to explore the area, is gross. We constantly see that idols are uncomfy with it and yet so many people still do it. Even recently Enhypen has been dealing with “fans” chasing them in airports and pushing/shoving them. They just spent hours on a plane and are probably exhausted, you think the best thing to do is run up to them screaming and pushing?!?. I get that people get excited at the thought of getting to meet their idols but let’s be honest it’s so rude. Interrupting dinners, chasing them down, following them at malls and such, is so selfish. There are ways to meet idols even if you are low income. I see people use that as an excuse “well I can’t afford tickets/fan meets/fan calls so I try to look for them at airports and stuff instead. Let’s be honest we all know that there are tons of idol groups who will do small meet and greets before and after concerts/ outside the venues. 
It’s disheartening and ruins it for others and the groups themselves when people don’t respect personal space and privacy of idols. It’s unsafe and stressful for everyone involved.

[Hanteo First Week Sales \(Change\)](https://preview.redd.it/sffj9ob28syc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ea54160f3543b735acdd232fbb2a8c0d1f699c2)

&#x200B;

It's been discussed before, but it appears for the most part, the Kpop album sales have reached a zenith. I couldn't happen to notice the last week of 2 powerhouse groups (SVT and IVE) were both down on their previous albums, and I wondered what the overall lay of the land was for the top groups.

&#x200B;

It appears that apart from a few outliers (such as NJ, and Twice - which could be an issue with their shipping manifesting as a first week sales increase), the overall landscape appears to be at most leveling out, if not declining slightly. The change of added up is -12.02%, or about 3 million albums less then the groups earlier album. This is focusing on Retail Hanteo sales - mainly Pre-orders of albums. Whilst there may be some differences with the Circle data, it roughly follows the same trend.

kpop_uncensored,1ci2wj4,2024-05-02 03:09:12,My Theory: Min HeeJin Is Using Bot Farms,"Hey guys, i really dont know how to start lol. I feel like a youtuber. Anyway you know there is a Hybe drama and i was so invested because i hate both Bang Pd (I'm an Engene and prob Engenes know the reasons) and Mhj (well she's a pe*o). I was sure that this was going to effect groups but i didnt think that it was going to this big. If you look at my account i've never been an Army. I have zero interest with BTS. I have zero reason to support Bang pd which i have comments about crictizing Hybe and Bang pd over sexualizing the young idols (Niki, Jungwon, Eunchae) and how he was treating Enha like his stepsons, overworking them bla bla. Anyway i really dont want to branded as company stan but my account is open you can read my old comments.

So the real deal is: How Mhj (or someone behind her) using the bots and it's way worse than you thought. Some people talking about bots in yt videos but guys the worst place is twitter.  I dont know how to say without sound cruel but idk about what's going on between them. A billion dollar company's shares are falling down, oh such a bad thing! But this cult thing made me so angry. Like i'm okay play your cards make your media-play. Hybe was the one who started to mediaplay by revealing everything to do media but using a cult rumor to get away from your crimes, dropping names? Girl you're the one who use pe****ilia as an aesthetic you're the last one who can talk. Also did we collectively forget that Park Jinyoung is an open cultist and he's in the cult who's allegedly responsible for Sewol?

Anyway i was always interested in Internet Bots and their effects on public opinion. If you want to read about this i can give you some recommendations but i dont want to this post to be too much politic. But i'm used to this bots and public manipulation because my country's president use bots to.

As i said i'm used to it, also i took some classes about finding the bots and avoid the misinformation on internet. Since Elon bought the Twitter and fired the half of the Twitter team AND created this blue check thing, there are more bots than ever. At least twitter team were deleting some of those accounts. But Elon literally doesnt care so twt is a misinformation world.

When i said finding the bots i didnt mean that i'm going to pull a Mr. Robot. We're just checking the accounts and try to see the patterns. I started with checking the popular tweets but Korean side looks worse. I'll write the things i checked one by one so you can check it too. Because i cant add 50 photos in one post and also there is a possibility that i got into the journalism thing so much, so bot accounts could still be real accounts.


First of all i searched on twitter about ""Hybe Cult"", ""Illit Plagiarism"", ""Bang Sihyuk"" ""Min HeeJin"". I collected 21 popular tweets. What i learned about my class: The most important thing is reposts/retweets. Tweeting about something doesnt make the topic popular anymore. Algorithym is more different right now. So bots are retweeting the main tweets to make them popular instead of writing 50 different tweet about that topic.

● FIRST IMAGE
So the first tweets i checked was the ones when i searched ""Illit Plagiarism"".The '1' photo is the first tweet i checked. I looked at the retweeters and realized the account '2' opened in April 2024, all of the posts they retweet either about other kpop groups or popular Anti-Hybe tweets. Which is such a normal thing. I use my second account to retweet things from my idols too. But then when i go back to the tweet '1' retweeters, i realized a pattern. Accounts either opened in January, February, March or April 2024. (I'm turkish so Subat/Feb, Mart/March, Nisan/April). They dont tweet anything. They only like or retweet. Which either about supporting Mhj, attacking Hybe or other kpop tweets. Liking and retweeting about other random things to not get caught is something bots do. I checked the accounts. In one of their retweet they praise Aespa's fandom power over boy groups, in another retweet they call Aespa flops because IVE passed them on album. Idk guys. Again i'm telling you, you can check them too. It's really not that long. All checking thing took my an hour while babysitting. But yeah writing takes the longest. 

This is the three accounts over one tweet. I'm not able to add but this post's reposters full of bots. Then before checking other viral tweets i looked the tweet in the photos '3 and 4'. And again i found the same pattern.

● SECOND IMAGE
Then we have another tweet i checked. I searched ""Hybe Cult"" on twitter. In photos you'll see a tweet written by user tricky. It' such a long thread and it's literally gold mine to find the bots. I find most of the bots on cult tweets. Photo 1: An account with no tweets, just retweets and only retweets things about this issue. It created in November 2023 but they only started to use in april. Photo 2 and 3 is belong the same account. Account created in April 2024, they have 455 posts but all of them retweets about Hybe Mhj drama. Photo 4-5: Again same account. Created in March 2024, again etiher retweet ciral tweets or this issue. Photo 6: Same pattern, created in april. Only retweets this. You can check that viral tweet. So many bots retweeting and liking it. I counted more than 60 bots and i didnt even checked half of the retweeters, but i'm not able to share on reddit. This is why i'm using collages :"")))

● THIRD IMAGE
A little tired but anyway. We have another tweet and i realized another pattern, no matter of when the account created, they only started to post in either in march or april. While i was checking this tweet i found so many bot accounts. But i'm adding this account as only example because until now i showed you the tweet and the reposters. But to understand how bots and manipulation works you need the see this. 1: Is the tweet, 2: Is the account. And the rest is the tweets they reposted. As much as you realize this account either reposted thing about this issue or yaoi. As i said bots try to not get caught so they like other random things but there is always a pattern. When i look at the other accounts they either like other kpop groups, yaoi, random viral tweets or animals. You can check the reposters of this post and you'll see that there are so many accounts like this example. After 10 minutes later i quitted because it has 3k reposters :/ but if you check it you can see bots too. 


My English is still bad sorry about this (i should have learned English before German), i'll try to explain it but if you dont get it please say it. Basically this bot farms give commands to the bots, and bots repost it. Basically it's just this. To not caught they gave them different command to like different things; but their aim isnt to hide themself. They are just trying to control public opinion. Make false posts to go viral so nobody learns the truth. So their abilities are limited. They repost 4 tweet about Mhj, then they repost 2 things about animals, 4 Mhj, 2 animals... 

And the real deal is Korean accounts but idk i was going to write it but i dont i have energy to write a post about it. Also i feel like i'm in another Slave Room thing, i talked so much about bots but there are main tweets. Such as the first Hybe Cult tweet. Anyway i wasnt able to give so much examples because somehow i couldnt add photos. But if you search the terms i said, look at the reposters and check the accounts, you can see the pattern too. What i wonder is; Hybe def was trying to do some mediaplay, but are they using bots too? I dont care about their well being but i hope this ends. I'm already bored HYBE WHERE IS THE ENHYPEN'S FULL ALBUM! Their first album had 6 songs 🥲 and it was in 2021.

Lastly, idk how things work in Sk but using this amount of bots isnt normal. Either Mhj paid so much money for bot farms or she has some back up. I tried to look at this Saudi Arabian investors but this thread is already full of theories i dont think we need that more.

Before end it, this is really nothing guys. Korean bots were worse. It's like i'm Katycat and watching Dark Horse Illuminati videos again. Min Heejin please next time use different patterns on your bots.",219,69
kpop_uncensored,1c5qptr,2024-04-16 22:40:18,Are bad vocals really a hybe issue?,"With the recent controversies surrounding lesserafim and now illit, a lot of people have chalked this up to hybe groups in general not being able to sing. It's understandable that lsfm and illit definitely need more vocal lessons, but why are people quick to say it's a hybe issue overall, when the other groups under hybe do fine? I feel like it's an exaggeration to say ""hybe's ruining kpop"" and all that. Even if we exclude groups like svt and fromis9 that have obviously always had great vocals before joining hybe, even groups that debuted under hybe aren't particularly bad vocally. Bts, txt, enhypen, newjeans, boynextdoor and tws are all very solid and have no issues singing live when they do, so I just don't get why people are so quick to say no hybe groups can sing when only two are lacking vocally. And even with those two, lsfm is a bit of a special case, considering most of them have either had very short training periods or none at all in the case of kazuha. I'm not saying these factors make their vocal issues any less apparent, but they're more of an anomaly than the standard. I realize I probably sound like a hybe stan right now which I assure you I am NOT, but it's unfair to group all hybe groups together just because of two groups being subpar in vocals.",256,358
kpop_uncensored,1c19b63,2024-04-11 09:43:19,I think kpop is becoming more mainstream ,"So earlier today I went to a baseball game to like hangout and touch grass and stuff but out of nowhere, they start blasting shut down. Very unexpected for the most american sport ever but I was pleasantly surprised. 

Then after the game I went into a supermarket to buy caffeine to feed my crippling addiction and suddenly super shy starts playing. What in the coincidence?!! Not once but twice? In the same day?

Then way later I had to go slave away at my part-time retail job and lo and behold, drunk-dazed starts playing (this one's actually way less of a coincidence cause I put my boss on enhypen but still).

kpop_uncensored,1byhj54,2024-04-08 00:32:13,Why are kpop fans so afraid to admit their favs aren’t the best at everything?,"it really confuses me like they’re people of course they aren’t going to be amazing at everything it’s normal, like my fav groups are enhypen, ive, and new jeans they don’t have amazing vocal abilities i know that and i can admit it - they are still able to have good music because they have good production and sing at their range they don’t have to be mariah carey incarnate to be considered a good musician. i mean look at the western industry celebrities like olivia rodrigo, or taylor swift, noah khan etc who are some of the biggest names they don’t have crazy vocal abilities yet they are still able to produce song that their fans enjoy. i don’t see what the big issue is in admitting that your favs can’t do everything - they’re going to have strengths and weaknesses. does enhypen have insane vocal ability? no. do they still have good songs and can put on a great preformance? yes!  like if your fav sucks at rapping (which most do) then who cares! if they can still put out a good song and are trying their best then what’s the issue?

that said i don’t think they can be horrible at their job like if you don’t even reach the minimum skill then maybe get another job - like you can have a weak spot but you can’t suck at everything you do

kpop_uncensored,1buefod,2024-04-03 02:11:39,Most people who use Open-Style rankings to rank idols in dance have no original opinions or critical thinking.,"P.S. no hate to the idols mentionned, I stan all dancers in k-pop and I am one myself lol

So within the last little while I started to learn about dancing in k-pop (to win fanwars ofc). While I won't say that I am the most professional dancer on the planet, I can say that I know enough to point out most k-pop dancers strengths, weaknesses, improvements, etc. 

If there is anything more annoying than blonks and uneducated dance rankings claiming lisa is the best dancer in kpop by miles, its definitely the Open-Style stans. For anyone who doesnt know, in 2021 I believe, a youtuber named K-pop Dance Deep Dives (KDDD) made a tiering system for dancers, ranking them from tier 7 (lowest for open-style), to tier 1 (the highest, but for now the highest idols on the list is Dino/J-hope in tier 2). While I will say that KDDD had some valid points in their videos, their ranking system is EXTREMELY underdeveloped (KDDD even said so themself, as their own opinion has changed a lot with the more research they have done).

Unfortunately, the pick-mesha's of K-pop who know very little about dance start to use the heavily flawed version of the ranking system to rank idols. And although these same people say that their rankings are their opinion, they will violently attack you for disagreeing with the ranking (even when its objectively wrong??????). Like girl no hate but in no world is 5 of the 7 members of enhypen better then Taemin...

These people who make the rankings will literally watch one video from a youtuber who uses the open-style ranking system and then basically copy-paste their opinions, or just play broken telephone with them. For example, KDDD once stated that Kep1ers Hikaru has solid footwork; from this, a youtuber doing a Kep1er dance ranking states that Hikaru has the best footwork in all of fourth gen, and then from that, a tiktoker goes on to say that Hikaru has the best footwork of all female idols. Again no hate but come on now... not even Reed Richards could stretch the truth that much like??? All love my girl hikaru, but for the love of god, theres no need to make such bold and uneducated statements when you've ranked all of about 5 girl groups in dance.

And on top of that, the people in the comments of these videos/tiktoks will attack you if you dared say that an ""overrated"" dancer is better than someone who ranks higher than them in open-style. If someone dared to say that chaeryeong is the best dancer in ITZY, they would be bombarded with comments like ""Chaeryeong isn't as good as ryujin because she's in tier 7 while ryujin is in tier 6"" or ""Yeji is tier 5 so she's the best dancer"". Meanwhile the only things that these commenters use to back up their arguments is that Ryujin has better pops and locks than Chaeryeong (the correct terms are hits and stops...) and Chaeryeong can't do much outside of ITZY Choreos, which again, is a copy-paste comment from one of these ""Open-Style"" ranking videos. I'm not here to argue about who is the best dancer in ITZY (because personally I think its actually J.Y. Park), but the lack of critical thinking is concerning. This behaviour is also seen a lot when it comes to the ranking of SM idols (as they are all seen as overrated according to the commentors and content creators?). According to the ranking system, most of enhypen are obviously better than Taemin, Hyoyeon, Taeyong, and Kai. But whenever a completely valid argument is made against this ranking, apparently that person is just ass-kissing SM idols and know nothing about dance... Not to say a person can't have their own opinions, but its definitely a crime in the open style community to think an SM dancer other than Shotaro is a good dancer.

Final point, 9/10 of these commenters or content creators actually have no idea what open style is, nor do they know how its applied into choreos, ESPECIALLY into girl group choreos. Most bg choreos are heavily influenced by open style, and incorporate elements such as krump, hip-hop, popping, and sometimes even contemporary. Additionally, what makes open style unique is that it is ""open"", meaning that the choreography and/or the dancer can develop their own style based on their own abilities. The problem with these ""open style"" rankings is that the content creators and the commenters see this dance genre as nothing more than ""groove, dancing big, and having good pops and locks"", while ignoring the fact that literally 99% of male idol dancers are often very tense and lack the ability to execute softer movements, as well as... literally every other important factor that influences open-style. With gg choreos, open style is something that is only now being more and more incorporated, and jazz-funk technique (i.e. attention to posture, lines, etc.) are often the main focus of their dances. The problem with ranking them solely on open style is that a) idols with groove and power are often ranked higher than idols who have objectively better technique, dynamics, etc. in their respective choreos (i.e. Jihyo being ranked higher than Momo), b) it tells you nothing about how well they execute their respective choreos, and only really focuses on the aspects that matter to open style like pops, locks, and groove (which in many cases, gg choreos are not groove-focused and can look awkward with it), and again, c) it doesn't take into account, and sometimes even discredits, idols artistry within their respective choreos.

Tl,dr; While I do think that open style rankings in general make some good points about certain idols' techniques which can be helpful in forming your own opinions and rankings, the whole concept of open style kinda gets lost through all of the misinterpretations of what open style really is, as well as throught the lack of critical thinking used by most of the people who make these ranking.

kpop_uncensored,1bufqdm,2024-04-03 03:11:44,Why does everyone hate 4th gen BGs?,"Okay so first time poster, long time lurker. I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now so here goes. 

I am a BG stan, always preferred their music and I personally find it easier to memorise and learn members (I do stan a few GGs but not nearly as many as I do BGs). I do listen to a lot of GGs, I just don't stan them. 

Now, I really enjoy 4th gen BGs (I've been a kpop stan since mid 3rd gen), but the hate and unwillingness to give any of their music a listen is honestly really irritating. It's not just 4th gen GG stans that hate on 4th gen BGs, it's 3rd gen stans too. Always complaining ""4th gen GGs have so much versatility but 4th gen BGs all sound the same!"", Like? No they don't? If you actually gave the time to listen to a group that's not Skz or Ateez then you'd see there is a LOT of variety (EDIT: not saying Skz and Ateez don't have variety btw, if people looked away from their most popular songs / title tracks, they'd find both groups have plenty of variety in their title tracks and b sides). 

People complain 4th gen BGs don't do ""interesting"" concepts anymore. They only do ""cool / noise"" concepts. No dark or sexy or cute concepts. But they do indeed do those concepts. You just have to LOOK. 

Kingdom has one of the most interesting concepts I've ever seen, and their music is absolutely stunning. I have yet to come across a song I don't like. And that's including b sides. 

I don't listen to Love Me Like by Omega X and think ""oh this sounds like Lay Back by Verivery"". They're so very very different. There are certainly BGs that do ""noise"" styles: Omega X, Stray Kids, Ateez, TFN, Cravity, BAE173, TNX, Noir, P1Harmony etc. But they all sound different. (Like I'm not gonna confuse SKZ and Cravity lol). And those groups do have other sounds, too. 

Then you have groups like Verivery, DRIPPIN, The Boyz (they're not technically 4th gen but they get lumped in there anyway), Golden Child (also not 4th gen but anyway), E'Last, CIX, AB6IX, that have AMAZING vocals, AMAZING choreos, and none of them do noise concepts (except for maybe one or two songs). 

Want a sexy concept? Then look no further than OnlyOneOf. They have a distinct sound and do mature concepts. 

Then you have other talented groups with a diverse variety of music like TXT, Enhypen, MCND, DKZ, Oneus, Onewe, Lucy, Xrdinary Heroes, Blitzers, etc etc etc. 

There is something for everyone. I see so many posts praising 4th gen GGs and their diverse concepts etc, when personally to me, most (I meat some, not most), of them have similar concepts. 4th gen BG songs ARE good, and ARE catchy, there are cute concepts, sexy/mature concepts, cool concepts, concepts with a story (Kingdom's entire discography, Burn It by Golden Child, etc), people only look at Stray Kids and Ateez and think that's how all 4th gen BGs sound. 

I have seen so many people, on twt, Instagram and here, complain about 4th gen BGs and not really giving valid criticism to why they don't like 4th gen BGs. It's honestly so hypocritical. 

Now I'm not saying 4th gen GGs don't get hate cause they do (Itzy, Le Sserafim, IVE, etc I've seen the hate trains), but 4th gen BGs seem to cop it the most and it's not even against a specific group, it's just a huge generalisation after they hear My Turn by Cravity then Asurabalbalta by TFN and think all 4th gen BGs sound like that. 

5th gen BGs are starting the get similar treatment, even tho xikers sound nothing like BOYNEXTDOOR or ZB1... 

Anyway, rant over. 

EDIT: I just want to add, I did say to me personally I feel that some 4th gen ggs have similar concepts, but that in no way means they sound the same. Cause they don't. IVE, Le Sserafim, StayC, aespa, NewJeans, tri.be, nature, babymonster, ILLIT, everglow, Itzy, etc don't sound the same at all. But some of these ggs do share similar concepts and that's what I meant. And they don't all stick to the same concepts either. 

Maybe I should have been more clear with what I meant. 

EDIT: Jesus Christ, some people in the comments are acting like I threatened their first born child. And also need to learn how to read. This wasn't meant to be a bg vs GG post, just a vent about my observations... I don't hate ggs, I'm not a hater, I'm not a hypocrite, and I don't think I'm superior for stanning bgs. I apologise if this post offended anyone

EDIT: Okay damn another edit. So now people are mad at me because I implied ateez has no variety. That's NOT what I said and NOT what I meant. I just used them as an example since they're one of the biggest groups to come from 4th gen and they did make ""noise"" music (yes, not all. I KNOW!). And also? ""Noise"" does NOT mean bad nor do I mean any hate. I am also an NCT stan so I KNOW that term was used to hate on 127, but in recent years people have taken the term and changed into a description of certain music. IT IS NOT AN INSULT! 

I am an atiny, and have been since debut. So I KNOW their variety and their discography. I apologise if my words came across as they did but it was not my intention. ",141,125

kpop_uncensored,1bh4xgg,2024-03-17 19:39:06,What is something you need to say to Kpop fans?,"Sunki.

People always said  the 'shippers' ruined them but WE ALL KNOW that the bullying situation ruined their friendship on camera.

And I don't think that's the only reason why SUNKI stopped speaking on camera too.Fans also don't know  what happened BTS.What if something else ruined them (eg.serious argument or maybe they just dated and broke up😂)

But what im trying to say is that fans should leave them alone.I feel like they will come back eventually,but for now,let them be and focus on an other duo or FIND A JOB.

Edit:
1.Sunki are sunoo and niki's duo name.I don't ship SUNKI.They were just friends as we know it so pls don't assume that im not jobless.

2.BTS means Behind The Scenes im not comparing anyone im not even an army guys.

3.Sorry yall i should've been specific 😭

4.That 'dating and breaking up' is just a joke between my friends😂 so i just added that in for laughs I don't actually think that 😭

Edit:
1.Im new here and this is my first ever post and it did good.

2.I don't understand some comments at all.Some are on about something else and some are claiming stuff i didn't even say.

3.Im not a shipper and I'm not even hating.I love sunoo and niki (all enhypen members)and would never hate or bias.I don't even have twt.

4.Im just ranting on here its not an opinion at all.Believe what you want idk.

Most of the groups I stan are boy groups (don’t ask me why, I don’t even know) but I do Stan some girl groups. Being a multi Stan has really been proven difficult for me when it comes to voting on things like music shows.  One of my most recent examples is when Enhypen and Seventeen were both basically neck and neck for a few music shows. I really enjoy both groups new albums and found it really hard to choose one to vote for. So many engenes and carats saying to vote on all platforms. I ended up not voting for either. As a multi Stan, how do you support all of your groups?",5,6

They were easily one of the top 10 most popular groups internationally, maybe even top 5 at one point. The biggest names at the time were BTS, BLACKPINK, TWICE, EXO, GOT7, NCT, SEVENTEEN, Red Velvet, MONSTA X, and iKON.

But now I rarely see anyone mentioning GOT7. I could name 18 groups that are more popular and trending now: BTS, BLACKPINK, TWICE, Stray Kids, TXT, ATEEZ, SEVENTEEN, IVE, NCT, NewJeans, LE SSERAFIM, ENHYPEN, aespa, ITZY, BABYMONSTER, NMIXX, TREASURE, i-dle.

kpoppers,1l55soz,2025-06-07 00:47:41,Bad Desire - Enhypen sounds so much like Mirrors - Justin Timberlake it's driving me insane,"Title. It was the first thing I noticed on my first listen, like I had to pause and figure out what song it was reminding me of because it was bugging me that bad. It's not just me right? I swear they're in closely related keys or SOMETHING, you can just sing one over the other without it sounding very off. The producers had to have taken inspiration, no? I swear I've only seen like one random 10 view YouTube short (or something) about how similar they are, it can't be an unpopular idea, is it? Then again, I'm not fully tuned into Engene discourse so maybe I'm just not seeing it. It's not just me right?!? (edited for formatting)

Its been a few weeks since sale started but I've been checking on the prices every now and then. What the fuck do you mean that the highest ring pays more for their tickets than I did?! (first 2 photos). I myself have vip1 for 475 btw and the fact that second ring tickets are this expensive is not okay. Someone I know also checked on some other places and found tickets in the US for 23k... this is genuinely not okay. Also I just looked and I saw tickets for 500 right? (last 2 photos) Guess how much those tickets 4 rows behind them costed. Only like 200. Ticketmaster needs to fix this shit and equals these god damn prices man.

I DON’T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PLAYLIST TO MAKE NEXT! GIVE ME SOME IDEAS IF YOU HAVE ANY",18,21
kpoppers,1kvvd21,2025-05-26 16:12:01,Does your fav groups' line distributions bother you?,"For me, it depends

Bts - Jin needs more lines as he has a vocalist position and he is a really good singer😭😭

Twice - Momo shines in dancing and she is the one of the weakest vocalists in the group, so even if she's my bias i get to see her a lot in different things so it doesn't bother me so much

I-dle - Shuhua doesn't want too many lines herself and i respect her, even tho i love her voice and would want to hear more from her as she is my bias, i still don't mind the line distribution and respect her decision

Txt - Beomgyu has such a nice voice i would like to hear more from him (and you guys should listen to his solo 'panic' it's really good)

Enhypen - the thing is, niki is my fav vocalist in enhypen but as he shines a lot as a main dancer, i don't mind him getting the least lines even tho he's my bias

Aespa - Giselle has SUCH A NICE voice and my issue is SM doesn't let her shine not even as a rapper in the group😭 She has even mentioned how she has lost a little interest in music I THINK?? i'm not sure. but her solo 'dopamine' is my fav one amongst all the ae members i like it smmm her voice is really great and she pulled a vocal song greatly as a main rapper im so proud of her truly a good idol

Bigbang - Daesung is the lead vocalist and he is my favorite vocalist in bigbang omg😭😭 I needed to hear his voice more in songs but he recently had a solo album which u should stream !! So im glad to hear him sing and shine as a vocalist

Njz - I think Minji's voice is really good but i can see why she has the least lines, but still, the line distribution of 'Hurt' is RIDICULOUS for Minji's sideeeee😭😭

Le sserafim - Sakura has such a good voice and it's really elegant but she herself is more comfortable with getting less lines i think so regardless, i love her as a vocalist

soo what is ur opinion on ur fav groups' line distributions?? does it annoy you or are you perfectly fine with it?",8,58
kpoppers,1kvupot,2025-05-26 15:44:24,Which survival shows did you actually enjoy?,"It's quite hard to find an interesting and well-made survival show these days, though I'm aware that a lot of that can be attributed to the budget and size of the company producing it. Most of the shows I've come across tended to be quite dragged-out and included a lot of filler activities/challenges (If anyone's seen the Twice Survival show 'Sixteen', there's a LOT of this lol) that I assume are intended to let the audience 'get to know' the trainees a bit more, but it eventually gets a little repetitive. 

Personally, I-land S1 surprised me in being so good, considering I wasn't necessarily an Enhypen fan when I watched it. The show was really good at familiarising you with the trainees quickly, instead of completely sticking to the same few 'main characters' (not to say that it didn't do this at all). The drama was really entertaining too, albeit a little forced at times with a few people falling victim to the villain edit lol. Specifically, the choice to suddenly switch to fan voting in the latter half of the season helped keep things interesting instead of sticking to the same formula every episode, which most of the other shows I've tried tend to do. I have to say that I think it was the one show that I truly got invested into the emotional parts of too, and I think there were some really profound stories in the show that made you want to root for certain people (i.e. Sunoo, Jay, Taki and Niki all had such interesting developments). 

That said, I think the producers' approach to the show was a little unethical. It seemed extremely stressful for the participants, making it hard to watch at times. I guess this is just one of the consequences of throwing trainees this young into such an unnatural, high-stakes situation.

Anyway, do you have any thoughts or recommendations on some survival shows? I'm looking for some to watch/avoid, so let me know what you guys think.

kpoppers,1ktqmfg,2025-05-23 20:18:47,Songs you don't get the hate for,"Boys like you by ITZY.. I don't, i never did, and will never understand why it's ""worst"" or ""worse"" than Sneakers.. This song is such a banger and i don't really think that lyrics are THAT cringe?? It's just a little bit cheesy and high school type love story. I don't like itzy's newest releases either but this song was not as bad as everyone said (but Imaginary friend was so good)

Sticker by NCT 127. I will never get the hate istg, as an nctzen i really love this song. It's not even bad

Savage by Aespa, i mean i get tired of it if i listen to it more than 2 times too but it's not even bad. I like it

O.O by NMIXX. Seriously, everyone acted like this was the worst debut song ever to be produced and i was caught off guard cause it's not even bad at all.

Billy poco & Hey tayo by Enhypen. Honestly, when i became a new engene i wouldn't interact with the fans on social media and would mainly be on Spotify, and when i was listening to these songs they became my favorites for a while until i listened to their much better songs. But they are still good to me, i was shocked when i found out that people hate them

Dynamite/Butter by BTS. I get it, it's overplayed and overrated but they are not bad, but Butter isn't really something i would listen to

Zimzalabim by Red Velvet. Just bc it sounds like a cult song to some people?? I can't believe it, it's a really good song😭😭

Queencard by I-dle. Istg you guys just hate fun, cause it's a BANGER. 

Batter up by Babymonster. I mean it got overplayed by me but i still like it especially the outro. IMO, Sheesh was worse.

Signal by Twice. i LOVE it.",14,43
kpoppers,1kp9t0d,2025-05-18 04:39:00,Best Kpop Song of the Year: 2021,"**PLEASE upvote the song that you want and don't comment it multiple times!** This has happened a LOT over the past few days and it makes it way, way easier for me to count votes **if you upvote the commenter who has already mentioned your song.** Thank you :D

I wanna be here, here, here because this grid is super close to being finished and Itzy just won the 2020 Best Kpop Song of the Year with their hit, Wannabe! Ryujin's shoulder dance will live on forever in the hearts and minds of all Kpop stans. Close honorable mentions go to Stray Kids' Gods' Menu and La Di Da by Everglow!

It's time for 2021, and I'm sensing that some newcomers and more 4th gen is about to enter this grid! There's Next Level by aespa (and Savage, actually), After School by Weeekly, Fever by Enhypen, and Eleven by IVE. 3rd gen (and 2nd gen, and 1st gen) continues with hits from both NCT Dream and NCT 127 in the form of Hot Sauce and Sticker, Butter by BTS, and Lilac by IU! Let's see who wins :))

kpoppers,1knx8gl,2025-05-16 12:12:38,Appreciating the K-pop & Lgbt interactions/moments,"Even though it's dangerous and rare for K-pop idols to support or show appreciation for queer people, there have been some moments, from what we know;

**YVES - SOLOIST/EX-LOONA**

- I think we all know about Yves, she has been very supportive of the queer community and a lot of people believe in her being a queer herself

- she has wore a t-shirt that says ""I love girls""

**I-DLE**

- Shuhua used to do V-live a lot, and a fan asked ""What should i do if like the same sex?""
Her answer was ""Just go for them. Just be brave and love them. Do not be silly."" The fan also said that ""What do i do if my parents do not approve of me liking the same sex?""
Shuhua answered: ""It's a good question. It's a good question. Love is your business, not your parents. So... I think... So have a good talk with your parents. And if they really love you they'll eventually accept it. Don't worry. You never know how big love can be.""

- Shuhua was in a fanmeeting and a fan told her that she came here with her wife/girlfriend (i think) and Shuhua was happy

- I-dle's song called ""Oh My God"" uses ""she"" in the chorus which in a lot of people's opinion, hints at WLW relationships being seen as a sin according to a lot of cultures

- Lily posted a pic with the caption saying ""Rainbow cake"" and ""Have a good June everyone! I love you! And i'm proud of you!"" on 1 June

- Jay had a fan call and the fan was lesbian but she was misunderstood because there is a stereotype of fans being straight/girlfriend stans. She asked for advice and Jay said that he will cheer for her.

- From what a fan said, Jake saw a banner that said ""BISEXUAL ENGENES 4 ENHYPEN"" and put his hand on his heart

- A polish fan told Sana that she was moving in with her girlfriend in a fan call. Sana said ""your girlfriend?"" and the fan agreed, she was happy and supportive.

**NCT**

I stan some groups, so two days ago I was thinking about the bias I have in each group, and upon thinking carefully, I realized that all or most of them are from abroad (not that they're completely foreign, but they're from there and their parents are Korean).

For example, Mark from NCT, Jake and Jay from Enhypen, and Joshua from Seventeen. 💓🫰

But I'm also attracted to those who cook, like Jin and Jungkook from BTS, and some others who are very well-liked by their group, like Yunho from Ateez.

But what surprised me the most is that most of my biases speak English 😆. I just chose them without thinking about it; I realized that's what most of my biases have in common.

**How the songs were selected:**

The songs were decided through a combination of [r/kpop's B-sides of 2024 TTT results](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1ibpdhs/rkpop_top_ten_tuesdays_results_your_top_bsides_of/), as well as the [songlist feedback survey we conducted on r/KpopRates!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoprates/comments/1k6108e/the_2024_in_bsides_rate_songlist_feedback_survey/).

Now, without further ado, let's introduce the 50 songs in the main rate (& the 5 songs in the bonus rate) that were selected for this rate, sorted by reverse alphabetical order:

#**Bonus Rate:**

The bonus rate is basically an extension of the main rate! It is a collection of host selections, as well as feedback survey favorites that couldn't quite make the main rate!

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not. Don't use commas (i.e ""8,8"") to separate your decimals!

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** - they are **optional but *HIGHLY* encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0). You can add them to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Stray Kids - I Like It: 2.1 I do not

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment.** Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* For this rate and most future rates, we have **a ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

kpoppers,1k7fxlu,2025-04-25 10:31:21,Loud Backtracks Are Not the Reason Why K-pop Groups Are Struggling to Make It Big in the West & COACHELLA RANT,"Loud Backtracks Are Not the Reason Why K-pop Groups Are Struggling to Make It Big in the West

A lot of people seem to think that the reason why kpop groups are not that popular in the west is because loud back tracks, but actually artist like Tate, Justin Bieber, & Sza have really loud backtracks. 
People seem to think that the reason why  BTS is so big in the west is because they sing live, it is one of the reasons but theres so much more than that.

I remember going to my first Justin Bieber concert in 2013 and i realized that half of his show was playback and the other half live, and thats ok because he had an awful touring schedule so ofc he was not gonna be able to sing all those shows without a lil help from playback.

But now i realized, he connects really well with the audience, i remember he hyped the crowd and also had a dj doing that, despite not singing the entire show live he DID connect with the audience.

I do realize groups are held up to a higher standard sometimes than solo artist when it comes to singing, its not the same a solo artist lip syncing a performance than a group, because a group can back each other up and dont have to sing an entire song alone.

Charlie XCX is arguably not a good singer but she HYPES the crowd, everyone can feel her energy.

So i believe the main reasons kpop groups are not making it in the west are.

- Not being able to connect with the audience, they perform for a camera not for the public
- Sometimes they focus too much on perfection to the point they look like machines, the west loves when things feel organic
- KPOP lacks creative freedom 

But most important thing to make it in the west is GOOD MUSIC, or at least easy to listen to, i love nct but a track like sticker is never going to be big in the west.


——
Extra: i feel like some groups could be bigger in the west if they focus more on organic performances (some groups just focus a lot on coming off as sexy or cool and sometimes that causes ppl to cringe btw)

Like Enhypen already has GOOD music, im a casual listener, but i saw a few clips of their concert before cochella and i thought they were really good, but when i went to their coachella performance it seemed lackluster, it led me down because i feel like they focused too much on looking cool and forgot to connect with the audience, idk that might be just me but i felt like their concert performances were better than coachella. 
(HEESEUNG AND JAY WERE UNREAL BTW, THEY DID SO GOOD) but maybe the set list was just a bit boring.

I also saw Jennie (and i didnt really listen to her album because the few songs that i heard i didnt like them) but omg her set was soooo good, you could feel her connecting with the crowd, she was not performing for the cameras, she was jumping with everyone, even when she was out of breath she did a really good job.

kpoppers,1k4wg3v,2025-04-22 05:14:42,"Boygroups growing on Instagram, TikTok but not on Spotify vs girlgroups with more monthly listeners but less engagement on insta","I recently notice that social media posts from BG getting more engagement and followers than girls. like San from ateez getting almost 400k new followers in a week and some stray kids dudes getting a million likes so easily, enhypen likes at coachella or when they do dance challenges, they easily surpass most GG videos but that doesn’t really translate well to streaming numbers on Spotify(using Spotify cause that’s what I use lol). Like most of the girls from katseye, illit, new jeans etc… usually don’t get more than 300k likes sometimes they go viral but it’s not like the boy bands which easily get more than 1M without much promotion yet they have less monthly listeners on Spotify that women do. Do you have any theories on why that might be ????



I was thinking maybe it’s cause girlgroups tend to do more tik tok music for trends but people might not be as parasocial with them like they are with men and fantasising about them or idk hahaha

2. More male-female idol interactions (ex. Wonhee and GUNWOOK (very short and Wonhee backed away quickly but no dating rumours), Minnie and Ten (whole mv tg, song, she laid on his lap and all, stream obsessed), Illit and Enhypen)

3. More fun music shows (idols dance more, talk to each other more and congratulate each other more)

4. Male-Female collabs (ex Zico & Jennie (not revolutionary but still), IU and Suga (already friends so again not revolutionary), Minnie and Ten (my favourite I fear, luckiest NCTzen ever) and Jin and Wendy/Yena

But my true ult, after realizing how much I regretted not keeping up with them, is ENHYPEN. I've told a lot of people that my ult is another group... I probably sound like a hypocrite to them (sorry lolz) but ENHYPEN is a group that has really helped me with my mental health, physical health, etc. they're my life savers so it feels wrong to call any other group my ult, but they're also a group in which I feel really late... Becoming a fan in May of 2024, so I regret not being there sooner... Sunoo is my sunshine and my comfort idol, I always find him when I'm feeling down and he *always* makes me smile. He's helped me become a better person and to strive for my dreams. So, I wanted to thank not just the k-pop community, but also my ENGENE family for just being you.

For those of you who aren't sure what ""six degrees of separation"" is, it's basically a theory that everyone is connected to everyone else, and that only six or less relationships/connections between people are required to link one person to another. For example, if I want to link myself to Enhypen's Sunghoon, here's what an example path could look like:

Me => My friend (who went to see ATEEZ's concert) => Yunho (who is in ATEEZ) => Sunghoon (who did a No Doubt dance challenge with Yunho)

Or, if I wanted to link Lesserafim's Chaewon to NCT 127's Doyoung, I could follow this path:

Chaewon => In IZ\*ONE with Yujin => Yujin performed Killer with Karina => Karina is in aespa, with Ningning => Ningning performed duet with Doyoung

That's basically the idea of the post! Put two idols down below in the comments and we'll all try to connect them with six connections or less :)",33,49

**How the songs were selected:**

Only top-ranking songs from each rate (outside of [Best Of](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoprates/comments/z9sfph/rate_the_1st_kpop_subreddit_song_rate/) and [Music Videos Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoprates/comments/16kazij/rate_the_kpop_music_videos_rate/)) were considered for the rate, by nature of the theme. Japanese Songs Rate entries will be eligible for next All-Stars rate.

We have decided that artists can only get a max of 2 songs on one All-Stars Rate, to increase artist variety and diversity. Also every rate here will have a minimum of 3 songs in All-Stars (except for Pre-Debut LOONA due to artist limit), and a maximum of 4 songs.

---

Now, without further ado, let's introduce the 70 songs that were selected for this rate, ordered chronologically by rate date and their placement on said rate:

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not. Don't use commas (i.e ""8,8"") to separate your decimals!

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** - they are **optional but *HIGHLY* encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0). You can add them to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Sugarcoat (Natty Solo): 9.8 I won't sugarcoat it, she deserves her rightful crown

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment.** Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* You can also give a comment for each rate, like so: 

> Rate: 2019 in K-Pop: yeah, but where is the best song of 2019, Superhuman?

* For this rate and most future rates, we have **a ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

kpoppers,1iu0juy,2025-02-20 16:05:14,"K-Poppers with stan parents, how did you get there?","Helloo!!

I don't know how I haven't posted about this yet, but I accidentally turned my mom into the craziest multistan and it's so fun! 

I got into K-POP in late 2018 through BTS and they became my ult. For YEARS they were the only one I stanned, and then I kinda fell out of K-POP in mid 2021 because of some personal stuff happening. I moved in with my mom in January 2023, however, and by late September had started getting back into the music that made me happiest. I was familiar with other groups, had ATEEZ's entire discography in my library prior to my leave, and knew a single song from my current ult (I love you ENHYPEN 🥹). 

It started with BTS Dionysus stage mix popping in my head. I had it on replay one day, giggling and whatnot over it because yeah. My mom got home from work, looked at the TV and was like ""Is that BTS?"" and I joked like ""What? Noooo! They're Korean guys!! This is uh... A Taiwanese girl group!"" to which she shook her head n said ""I heard you talk about them enough back in the day to know that's BTS. You don't gotta be ashamed of a damn music genre."" This was a flabbergasting statement to me, because before I moved in with her, the people around me constantly clowned me for my interest, even though I got into it when I was 11. At this point, I was 16, almost 17. 

I rewatched it one more time and was gonna turn it off, but she came from changing in her room and was like ""You don't have to turn it off,"" and I definitely took that and RAN. I started playing some of their MVs, and I noticed she perked up when I played Daechwita. Like, put her phone down, locked IN to watch it. Before that, all she'd said about them was that ""they're good dancers"" and ""the aesthetics are pretty"". She asked me who was on the TV now, and I said ""Agust D, aka Suga of BTS"". She was bamboozled, but also familiar with him! ""He's the guy off that Juice WRLD song?!"" (Girl of My Dreams) and I told her a bit about Yoongi. 

She was VERY hesitant about anything she said, but she admitted that Yoongi was cute. ""He's a '93 liner"" and BAM she was in this game. She was scared he was like, 20, but hearing that made her fall into the pit. I played more Agust D, more BTS, and in a month's time she was learning their names through a slideshow I made, watching guides, started RUN BTS, all of that. And her bias quickly became and still is Yoongi.

But wait-- there's more. I couldn't just stop there! So I showed her the dearest music video to me... Say My Name by ATEEZ. She digged it, and then we found Bouncy and started stanning. Then I showed her SKZ, my ""grocery store album"" (MIROH), and we stanned. Then, I finally showed her Drunk-Dazed. This was also in Dark Blood era, Bite Me was EVEYRWHERE, and I fell down a rabbit hole and have been a proud ENGENE + ENHA ULT since November 2023. I finally showed her Cat & Dog by TXT and she is the MOA to my ENGENE (despite both of us stanning both lmao). We worked on standing SVT all through 2024, and now, in February 2025, are about to go to our 2nd K-POP concert! Last year in May was ENHYPEN (the most amazing experience of my life) and going to the same place to see Hobi!! I'm so lucky to have a multistan mom lmao. 

If anyone's curious, here's her bias list + mine. 

MOM:
BTS: Yoongi (Ult)
SEVENTEEN: Jeonghan
ATEEZ: Hongjoong
STRAY KIDS: Changbin
TXT: Taehyun
ENHYPEN: Sunghoon

**How the songs were selected:**

We used the [/r/kpop Upcoming Monthly Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/archive) to comb through all K-Pop releases from the second half of the year. From there, we examined multiple factors: how many upvotes the MV received on r/kpop, how many Spotify streams a song has, how popular the artist is overall and on Reddit, overall balance, and several other factors. We also used the [r/kpop ""Best of 2024"" TTT results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LF7TGxxKaHBBk324N-nkEXleNVWSLc1MVSUC8JXkzqI/edit?usp=sharing) to gauge what songs Reddit preferred in 2024.

-----

Now, without further ado, let's introduce the 60 songs (and the 7 bonus songs) that were selected for this rate, ordered chronologically by release date:

#**Bonus Rate:**

The bonus rate is basically an extension of the main rate! It is a mixture of 'songs that came close to making the main rate' as well as some host selections!

**The Bonus Rate is optional** and **you do not have to submit a score for every song in the bonus list** if you do it: you can score none of them, all of them, or any number in between. **You cannot give a 0 or 11 to any song in the bonus,** as they are not part of the main rate. While it is optional, we hope you consider participating.

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.9 is fine, but 6.99 is not.

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** \- they are **optional but** ***HIGHLY*** **encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! Comments are also encouraged but not required for such scores (except if you give a song a 0).

* **Comments are encouraged and much appreciated** (but not required, except for if you give a 0) and can be added to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

> Cheeky Icy Thang: 9.6 Okay boomer

* **This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment**. Please do not include colons (ex. 9: I stan!), dashes (ex. 3.3 - This song sucks), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* For this rate and most future rates, we have a **ballot average minimum of 4.00**. In addition, if your ballot average is **between 4.00-5.50, you must leave comments on your lower scores** (which we define as any score that's a 3 or lower). {Do not worry about having to calculate your ballot average, once you submit your ballot, we will tell you if you need to make changes to your ballot for it to be accepted.}

But it felt so fresh to have such a complex emotion tied to your vocal tone since most kpop songs' vocals are lowkey kinda flat and sometimes even unemotional, like I need something like pain, Im 37 years old and after a 10 year relationship we fall apart but not in a sad pitiful way, I NEED SUM I cant carry on typa action or somethinggff
bonus points if they slur their wordddssssssssss < example

Other desperate songs ik (and do it good) are Fatal Trouble - enhypen (REALLY GOOD VIBE) and Silent cry -S stray kids (to a lesser extent but very 'sad' in a diff way)

kpoppers,1i0d192,2025-01-13 13:39:43,Day 85 of picking the better one of the same named songs: Blossom,"ZEROBASEONE (In Bloom) has won for Bloom! 

The Rule For Winning (PLEASE READ):
I will write three-four artist names in the comments myself, and for any artists that aren't there, only one comment with their name will be accepted. (For example, let's say Group A was commented twice. I will not count the one that was commented later, even if it gets the most upvotes.) Of course, there can be as many different K-Pop artists as there are.

Non-kpop answers aren't accepted. If you do comment one, even as a joke, you will likely be downvoted. This doesn't include collaborations between a kpop artist and a non-kpop one.

I recommend looking through the comments first before commenting the artist you want to vote for, since this way the votes won't be split into many comments, which increases the chances of winning. Remember, the top comment wins each day.

Anyways, today's one is ""Blossom"". Song titles that have up to two more words along with the word of the day are also accepted. The artists I will be commenting are ENHYPEN and Lia. Again, you can comment different artists. 

The winner will be decided at (around) 12.30-13.00 pm GMT, or 07.30-08.00 am EST. If two comments have the most upvotes, the winner will be decided the next day.

Let's see which one will win!",35,33

kpoppers,1hsgthz,2025-01-03 08:13:44,I need engene/kpop fan friends who can relate to my struggles lol ,"I've been a fan of enhypen since i-land era, but I lie-low during 2023-2024 because I'm afraid that I'll become someone who loves to collect merchandise and attends every concert and fan meets. I'm not someone who has money for those. However, this holiday break, due to boredom and feeling of loneliness, I brought myself back to being an engene. I recently watched and rewatched their YouTube videos and I realized how happy I am when I'm with them. 

I'm also a lowkey fan of seventeen (since don't wanna cry era), and txt (since crown and runaway era!). I also love these two groups, they're so precious lol.

But all in all it was well balanced I would say (except for the whole hybe-ador thing). My favorite part of this year would be the release of XO(Only if you say yes) by Enhypen, that song just did something to me in a sense I can’t explain, I just feel it. My worst part of this year would obviously be New Jeans, I wish that issue would be resolved by the first half of next year and provide us fans with a bit more info so that we can understand what’s going on and take a stand against or for. 

So ye, the year was a roller coaster ride and I hope next year we’ll have a more fun and happy year in the K-pop scene.

*Hey everyone, welcome to the final rewind of the week. Today, I'll be looking at my top five male artists of 2024. These are artists who kept pulling me back for more and who kept popping up on my playlist. Just like the female list I delivered yesterday, I'll tell you my three favorite songs the artists released this year and my favorite album from this year they made. Then I'll let you know why I picked them. Before we jump into the list, thank you for coming along with me as I looked back on Korean music and shared my favorites with you all. I'll see you all this evening for an early episode of Into the Music. Now, let's jump into the list.*

5.[ Fleeky Bang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGCQiN_nl-LmFIxg6BJgW5lAW30gnUiKo)

Songs: My Name is, 악마 (惡魔) & Dirty Gang

Album: N/A

*Fleeky Bang, a rapper in the Korean Hip-Hop world, is coming in at number five. He released two albums that stuck with me throughout the year. The Predator 2, released in January, became my first obsession of 2024. I remember listening to the record repeatedly as fantastic tunes kept pulling me back for more. My Name is Featured Tray B, who always fits wonderfully with Fleeky, and I hope they make a collab album together. One thing I love about Fleeky is that he can work with most rappers and make the collaboration slap. In October,r, he released his second album of 20, AKUMA, another one of my obsessions. His collaboration with Sik-k ended up in my top twenty songs of 2024, as I've been listening to that one on repeat. I can't wait to see what he does in 2025 with his music and all the artists he works with.*

4. [H3hyeon](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYHRAcG87vea4P8X93wSDJ27fMcglXtxV)



Songs: Workaholic, 나 없이 잘 살아 & Marry My Bed

Album: 머뭇머뭇

*H3hyeon hits number four. He has delivered two smooth R&B mini albums that kept popping up on repeat for me. In March, he released his first album of 2024, which had the pre-release single Workaholic. His smooth vocals fit wonderfully with Ash Island, which was featured on the pre-release. I've always found H3hyeon underrated, as he puts out some killer music that keeps getting stuck in my head. In October, he dropped his second album this year and another one that kept popping up on my playlist. We see Ash Island working with him again; they fit perfectly together. Loco lends a verse on the tune Gag Concert, and to my surprise, they both fit well together. Keep up the good work, H3hyeon, and keep putting out the high-quality music I know you can make.*

Songs: 내가 S면 넌 나의 N이 되어줘, hey! hey! & Fire Confetti

Album: TWS 2nd mini album ‘SUMMER BEAT!’

*Pledis Entertainment, home to Seventeen, debuted its newest boy group this year, Tws. The group debuted in January, but I found them in February. It didn't take me long to fall in love with this group's sweet sound and smooth vocals. The group's debut was one that I started to have on repeat until they released their second album in June. hey! hey! It was pre-released from their second album, and it's been on repeat ever since. I'm glad this group has debuted cause they sound fresh, and. They put out smooth synth-pop tunes that keep getting stuck in my head. Even their latest comeback, Last Festival, has been in my head. 2025 is another great year for this new group as they grow artistic with their music.*

2. [Enhypen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0N0b7tW2CM&pp=ygUUZW5oeXBlbiBwcm9maWxlIDIwMjQ%3D)



Songs: Brought The Heat Back, LUCIFER & Royalty

Album: DARK MOON SPECIAL ALBUM <MEMORABILIA> - Enhypen

*Enhypen comes in at number 2, having a busy year releasing all kinds of music that has been stuck in my head. In May, they released their Dark Moon Special album one, which has two of my favorite Enhpyen songs from 2023: Criminal Love and One in a Billion. Lucifer is a new track from the project with its smooth, dark vibe that works perfectly for Enhypen's overall sound. In July, the group returned with their second studio album that brought us the banger Brought the Heat back, which kept pulling me back for more. While I liked three songs from the record, I still found it to be one I kept returning to a lot. In August, we saw Enhypen teaming up with Ava Max for a collaboration version of Brought the Heat Back, which helped the tune get stuck in my head once again. One thing I saw in 2024 was the group growing even more on me as they are starting to become one of my favorite Boy groups that keep putting out tunes that keep impressing me more and more.*

1. [Xdinary Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggENY04XG24&pp=ygUceGRpbmFyeSBoZXJvZXMgcHJvZml1bGUgMjAyNA%3D%3D)

Songs: iNSTEAD, Money on My Mind & LOVE and Fear

Album: Troubleshooting

*For me, the male artist who takes over 2024 comes from JYP, but it's a band. Xdinary Heroes comes crashing into 2024 with killer tunes that showcase the band's musical growth. In April, the band exploded with Troubleshooting, their first studio album, one that hit hard with the instrumentation and the vocals. Money on My Mind has been my most played song from the album, as it keeps pulling me back. From June to September, the band released one new song before their mini album Love and Fear, which has so many killer tunes on it. iNSTEAD features some screaming vocals from Yoon Do Hyun, as I didn't expect an Xdinary Heroes song to have to scream in it, but I'm glad they did that. 2024 was the year the band evolved their sound in a new way, showing them growing even more. I would love to see their music get even darker since iNSTEAD almost had a hard-rock/metal vibe, and I would love to hear from them again. I hope the band grows their sound even more in 2025 and beyond.*

5. [Hanaroro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtAXQ-DPAh0&pp=ygUPaGFucm9ybyBwcm9maWxl)

Songs: ㅈㅣㅂ, 나침반, 귀가

Album: N/A

*My fifth favorite artist of 2024 is my discovery of the year. Hanaroro is an indie artist who popped out of nowhere with her album Home, which was on my top 10 album list. One cool fact about the singer is that she helped write and work on Stepping Stone by TXT and wrote the lyrics for Nightmare by Taeyeon. I did check out her past releases and enjoyed them as I kept returning to them. Hanroro's sweet voice blends wonderfully with the production she brings to the table. I've noticed my love for Korean indie has grown over the years, and Hanroro is another one I can add to the list of indie singers that captivate me with their singing and production.*

Songs: Born to Be, Five & Blossom (Lia Solo)

Album: Gold

*ITZY hopped onto my list as the swang into 2024 with an album that hit hard. Born to Be was an album that kept pulling me back for more, but one missing thing was Lia, who was on hiatus. Lia delivered Blossom, which was a tune that warmed my heart. Even the other solos from the members were fire. We did get a new Japanese single called Algorhytm, which was another thing that was on repeat for me. When Lia returned to the group from Hiatus, the group released Gold, which had some Final versions of Born to Be tracks plus new tunes. I've been obsessed with Gold as it's been on repeat for me since October, and it excites me for what 2025 will bring to the table.*

3.[ IVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0msDnSADBA&pp=ygURaSd2ZSBwcm9maWxlIDIwMjQ%3D)



Songs: Ice Queen, Crush & Supernova Love

Album: N/A

*IVE opened the year with All Night, an English remake of Icona Pop's song All Night, but this version featured Saweetie. IVE and Saweetie still don't make me like the track. I found it something that made me worried for the group's year. The second thing IVE did this year was release Will, the theme song for Pokemon Horizons, which I got the theme stuck in my head as I've been listening to it on repeat. The group released their second mini album, one I remember listening to a lot as the songs were something I enjoyed, but Reset was the only skip for me. In August, the group released Alive, their second Japanese album that included Will and Crush. Both were pre-released and are still some of my favorite tracks. The group recently dropped Supernova Love with David Guetta; I've been playing that a lot. IVE had a rocky start to the year, but the group proved that this year would be great for them, making me even more of a fan.*

2. [Candy Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fYfuXsBf0Y&pp=ygUXY2FuZHkgc2hvcCBwcm9maWxlIDIwMjQ%3D)



Songs: Good Girl, Tumbler (Hot & Cold) & No Fake

Album: #Hashtag

*Candy Shop, the newest group from Brave Sound, debuted with their first mini album in March of 2024. The record became one of my obsessions that month, as I couldn't stop listening to it. It's hard for me to pick a favorite song from their debut, as I love all the tunes that they offer. The group's smooth vocals kept pulling me back to these catchy tunes that stuck with me for a while. In June of 2024, the group returned with their second mini album, another catchy one that also stuck with me. Hot & Cold is a b-side from that project that became one of my favorites, but the whole album is just as good as their debut. I can't believe Candy Shop became my second favorite group of 2024, and it didn't take them long to do so.*

1.[ ILLIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUIM3OVYRAk&pp=ygUSaWxsaXQgcHJvZmlsZSAyMDI0)



Songs: N/A

Album:N/A

*My favorite female artist of the year comes from Belift, the home of Enhypen. ILLIT is the catchiest group and artist of 2024, and their music has been stuck in my head all year long. Their debut album, Super Real Me, delivered a song called Midnight Fiction that ended up on my top 20 song list. The title track, Magnetic, was another favorite of mine, and it did get three remixes that also kept popping up on my playlist. I love how sweet the member's vocals are, as they are one thing that helps bring me back to their music. In October, the group delivered I'll Show You, their second mini album with even more catchy pop tunes to keep my ears wanting more. Cherish was the title track that also got some remixes like Magnetic did, but it's hard to pick which title track I like more. The B-side Pimple showed the group's acoustic side, which I loved. Tick-tack might be the group's catchiest song, as it's been stuck in my head since I released. I'm not surprised ILLIT took over my year, as they've been stuck in my head since their debut.*

kpoppers,1hdbc92,2024-12-13 13:40:58,Day 54 of picking the better one of the same named songs: Sweet,"aespa has won for Whiplash! 

The Rule For Winning (PLEASE READ):
I will write three-four artist names in the comments myself, and for any artists that aren't there, only one comment with their name will be accepted. (For example, let's say Group A was commented twice. I will not count the one that was commented later, even if it gets the most upvotes.) Of course, there can be as many different K-Pop artists as there are.

Non-kpop answers aren't accepted. If you do comment one, even as a joke, you will likely be downvoted. This doesn't include collaborations between a kpop artist and a non-kpop one.

I recommend looking through the comments first before commenting the artist you want to vote for, since this way the votes won't be split into many comments, which increases the chances of winning. Remember, the top comment wins each day.

Anyways, today's one is ""Whiplash"". Song titles that have up to two more words along with the word of the day are also accepted. The artists I will be commenting are xikers (Bittersweet), Purple Kiss (Sweet Juice), NewJeans (How Sweet) and Enhypen (Sweet Venom). Again, you can comment different artists. 

The winner will be decided at (around) 12.30-13.00 pm GMT, or 07.30-08.00 am EST. If two comments have the most upvotes, the winner will be decided the next day.

(Also I know there are female groups who were always at the top too like SNSD, TWICE, Blackpink and more, but I'm just genuinely curious who willl be the next big thing among boy groups.)

I know there are a lot of next gen front runners now like Stray Kids, NCT, TXT, ATEEZ, ENHYPEN. But I don't think theyre on the boss level yet.. like they haven't really become known or appealed to the ""Korean General Public"" like to some random market vendor auntie or to a chronically offline salaryman compared to the four groups I mentioned above.",47,129
kpoppers,1h1vct6,2024-11-28 13:55:46,"Which idol do you see having a big career in a few years, once they go solo?","I've been thinking about how some idols seem destined to shine even brighter once they go solo. Whether it's their vocal talent, charisma, stage presence, or ability to connect with fans, some people just have that ""it factor.""

Two idols that come to mind for me are Karina from Aespa and Heeseung from Enhypen.

Karina has already demonstrated how she can also break charts on her own with her solo song ""Up"", which she has won an award for in music shows.

And Heeseung just reminds me of JungKook in many ways. He has that IT-Boy persona in him. He can sing, dance, perform, he's a great visual. He's got it all to go solo in a few years.

But that's just my take! Who do you think has the potential to make it big once they go solo?",113,91

kpoppers,1g7qsuo,2024-10-20 06:26:26,Non-idols in kpop that you have a crush on,"Curious if anyone has people in kpop they crush on who aren't idols? Like managers, guards, producers, choreographers, stylists etc. I've seen it happen a lot with bodyguards or managers people think are hot or cute (I've also heard some failed idols or former trainees go into management/handler role). The most famous I can think of is BTS old manager/Enhypen current (?) manager Sejin. The guy even had a fansite change their fansite to one for Sejin for April fools day. I believe Twice also had a manager people thought was kinda hot.

I ask this question because I have a fat crush on Maddox, a singer under KQ entertainment who produces music for their idol groups. Legit think I crush harder on him than any of the Ateez guys. I've noticed their other producer Eden seems to have some fangirls as well. 🙃 These guys are relatively young for producers tho so idk any other producers that would be considered attractive. 

Edit: I totally forgot how many backup dancers are physically attractive and go viral. You can definitely mention some of those too lol",52,60

The tunes this week hit hard as I kept returning to a lot of stuff released this week. I've been excited to talk about the tunes from this week as I have a lot of things I would like to say about them. I hope you all are having a great October as we get closer to Halloween. Let's jump into the music and see what the artists delivered.*

**Best of the Week:**



*October 14th & October 15th*



[Live and Fall - Xdinary Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kkkiZCRmM66gI-AaqmbJwdFc6x87fEXRU)/[Gold - ITZY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nyrMCcOsHzqTcjFDSlML-ZRn-mwYbtHAY)

*This week was an excellent week. As two releases took over, it was hard to figure out which one was my overall favorite, so I picked both. Ordinary Heroes released an album that hit hard with instrumentals that kept pulling me back for more. The new songs from the band fit well within the tracks we heard over the past few months. I love the different sounds the band delivered, like in INSTEAD with its screaming feature artist that fits wonderfully within the overall sound. Now, the day after, ITZY returned with a new album that marked the return of Lia, which still gives me chills each time I hear her voice. Imaginary Friend is one of my favorites on the album, as the smooth melody blends well with the vocals from the members. We did get re-recorded versions of Born to Be tracks that finally featured Lia. Both releases kept me interested, and I've been returning to them.*

**Korean Releases of the Week:**



*October 18th*



[APT. - Rose & Bruno Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFeEbjLJDmI&pp=ygUeQVBULiAtIFJvc2UgJiBCcnVubyBNYXJzIGF1ZGlv)

*Since Blackpink has been going solo, I have only recently fully loved them when Rose released her first single featuring Bruno Mars. This funky-pop tune has some catchy, earworm moments from the chorus to the verses. I love the delivery of the vocals that Rose brings to the table, as she blends wonderfully with the instrumental. Bruno sounds excellent, and the instrumental was made for him. At 1:43, it reminds me of Runaway Baby by Bruno Mars for some reason, but it works terrific. Rose and Bruno fit perfectly in this fun, catchy pop tune that will stick in your head.*

[Home - ENHYPEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkapjlAoZE&pp=ygUSaG9tZSBlbmh5cGVuIGF1ZGlv)

*ENHYPEN is back with a full English single called Home. The funky synths helped pull me into the mix, and the members delivered some smooth vocal tones. The hook is catchy to the core, and it's been stuck in my head since I first heard it. I've always loved it when ENHPYEN makes funky pop music because it fits their voices well. I'm glad the group is back with a fun single that will be on repeat for more.*

[Sukisugite Up and Down - Bokugamitakattaaozora](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k24dY0NAfJN5zT0rEv_LNQURUIBbiM9sU)

*Last Friday, Bokugamitakattaaozora returned with a song for an anime that I found decent. This week, the group returned with a new single that was much better and more interesting. I love the upbeat synth melody, which blends well with the sweet vocals, which keep pulling me back for more. The bright and colorful hook helps bring the vibe to life. Bokugamitakattaaozora is one of my favorite discographies, as I've been enjoying many of the songs they have been delivering. I hope the group continues putting out excellent tunes that will keep returning me for more.*

[Feel the Paulse - &TEAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-QjGqnyu-o&pp=ygUVZmVlbCB0aGUgcGFsdXNlICZ0ZWFt)

*&TEAM is back with another OST, this time for Golden Kamuy. The track opens with a pop-rock vibe that blends wonderfully with the member's performance. I love how much the members have grown as vocalists, as each song they sing becomes an obsession for me. The hook fits well with the guitars and percussion that crafts that pop-rock vibe. I would love to see a live band perform this tune with the group cause it might elevate it to another level.*

but now its blowing up w/ +200,000 interactions and ppl are dm'ing me. i'm super surprised, but it's not clear why it's so fun.

But I'm looking for those deep underground banger b-sides. For reference, here are some of my tastes:

• Huge nctzen as stated so l'm a fan of ""noise music""
• Other boy groups I like in general: txt, skz, riize, enhypen (only have really heard their newest album and am obsessed)
• Boy groups I'm interested in but don't know much about: bts, ateez, enhyphen, zerobaseone, tws, pharmony, xdinary heroes
• Girl groups I like in general: red velvet, mamamoo aespa, le sserafim, new jeans, blackpink
• Girl groups l'm interested but wanna know more about: kiss of life, ive (desperately need more gg in general)
• Soloists I like: taeyeon and taemin (need more!!)

Also any songs in general that are iconic in kpop no matter the era or artist. I wanna listen to all the groups or soloists that have shaped the kpop phenomenon and set an iconic standard for new generations too.

I also listened to some pretty fire tunes that were stuck in my head this month. I also want to mention that I've found my summer anthem and will share it sometime next month. We did have some warm days that made me wish for some cooler days. It didn't take me long to find my favorite non-Korean song of July, as it was released a few days ago.

Song: [Open Always Wins - TXT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoMnrKW3Rnw&pp=ygUWT3BlbiBBbHdheXMgV2lucyAtIFRYVA%3D%3D)

*TXT returns with a song for Samsung, and it takes over my month. This track is entirely in English and hits hard with the backing track. The vocals fit wonderfully with the guitar, which blends well with the thumping vibe that kept bringing me back for more. I've had the hook stuck in my head, which is something I'm surprised was stuck in my head. Usually, I find these CF tracks to be a little forgettable, but TXT returned with one that hit hard, taking over my month, and one that I'll be listening to for a long time.*

Album: Showdown - Lee Chae Yeon

*Lee Chae Yeon takes over my month with her new mini album, Showdown, which has grown on me over the past couple of weeks. Don't is the title track that gets stuck in my head each time it comes on my playlist. I love the bouncy vibe that blends well with the singer's voice. Summer Heat is another favorite of mine, as it delivers this Bollywood vibe I love. I was surprised she went with a Bollywood-type track, but I wanted to hear it again as I listened to it more. Dreaming is the album's ballad, letting the singer showcase the smooth vocals that hit each time. I'm glad Lee Chae Yeon could return with some new music, as I've loved everything she has been putting out.*

Song:[ anohiari - Nogizaka46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofgINVruAT4&pp=ygUKbm9naXpha2E0Ng%3D%3D)

*Japanese Girl group takes over with my favorite non-Korean release for July. The track delivers a sweet melody that kept pulling me back for more. The sweet vocals fit perfectly with the overall vibe, as I've been listening to this tune on repeat for the past couple of days. The overall vibe has this pure/magical feeling that put a smile on my face the first time I heard it. As I listened to this tune, I started to remember when I first discovered Nogizaka46 and instantly fell in love with the group. It took a lot of work to pick my favorite non-Korean release cause there were some good ones, but after hearing this tune, I knew which one I had to choose.*

*Hey everyone, today marks the return of Enhypen with their second comeback of 2024 and their 2nd Korean studio album. As a fan who thoroughly enjoyed their Dark of the Moon album, I was buzzing with excitement when I heard about the new music. This new project will likely be something I'll have on repeat. The prospect of exploring the romantic side of their music with this new project has me on the edge of my seat. Let's dive into this record and see what the group has in store for us.*

*The opening of this record immediately caught my attention with its synths that blend well with the smooth vocals. The vibe is dark, reminiscent of something from the Dark of the Moon album. The hook is decent, but it's not one of my favorites. The members put on an excellent performance that also helped to open up the album in a strong direction. I am unsure if I like this opener, but I need more time to sink in. What are your thoughts on this opening?*

*The project's title track opens with synths and other electronic effects. The bouncy instrumental blends well with the occasional glitchy vocal moments. I love the smooth nature of the singing, as it doesn't sound too in your face. The hook blends well with the overall vibe, and the glitchy nature returns. Each member brings something to the table, and all the members fit wonderfully together in this tune. Now we do get an English version featuring someone named JVKE. JVKE has a smooth voice that works well with the overall vibe as he comes in near the end for a verse. Overall, both versions are songs I'll be coming back to.*

Sythns open up the track, bringing in a funky vibe that the members fit wonderfully with. The backing track sounds like it has a disco vibe to it, as the instrumental gives off that feeling to me. The hook is decent, as it only does a little for me. I like the vocals from this group, but in this tune, it sounds like they are playing it way too safely. This tune may grow on me, but I wouldn't say I like this song. It may grow on me as I hear it, but we must see.

Synths open up the track as the vocals have effects added to them. The vibe goes for this retro/city-pop sound that works well with the group. Each member delivers some smooth vocal moments that I'm enjoying. The hook is decent, as it blends well with the overall momentum the producers crafted. Thanks to the synths, I love the magical elements you can hear in the backing track. This one will be on repeat for me as it's one of the most extended tracks on the album and one that gets fleshed out better.

*The group goes for this funky dance-pop instrumental that sounds more alive than the last few tunes. I can see this tune getting stuck in my head as more is going on with the vibe. The member's vocals are sweet, fitting wonderfully with the overall vibe, and the hook has more of a catchy vibe than what we've heard in this album. This song might be my favorite on the album, as it's more memorable than we've heard. I love the bridge that breaks everything down before the funky hook returns.*

*A guitar opens up the track, bringing in a pop-rock vibe with a bit of trap/drum and bass elements. The vocals are smooth and work well with the vibe, which could've added more. At least the hook hits a little bit, as it's one memorable section I can remember from this tune. The members put on a performance that tries to improve this song, but it needs more feeling. I wanted to like this tune, but I feel it could've been fleshed out better after hearing it.*

*A clapping guitar opens the song, bringing in that funky vibe again—this time, I like it a lot. The members' performances sound better than the last track's, helping make Royalty much more memorable. Even the chorus is much more memorable than what I've heard on some of this record. The verses have this smooth vibe that works well with the group's vocals. I find Royalty to be another moment on the album that I'll be returning to a lot cause it works well with the group.*

8. [Highway 1009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNbkPaR6OI&list=OLAK5uy_luzvsG76YoFHD04gaLWXG6pIFNsFmbIfY&index=8&pp=8AUB)

The last Original song on the album opens with a smooth guitar melody. The group goes for a ballad that ties everything together. The sweet vocals almost make this tune sound like a lullaby. This ballad is the sweetest tune on the album, as it works well with the group's songs. The instrumentation helps bring out that sweet vibe that works well for the group.

Summary: *I don't hate Enhypen's new album, but many of these two-minute songs need to be doing more. A lot of this record needs to be fleshed out better to make the tune deliver more than they do. The group's Dark of the Moon project sounds much better, as those songs are more memorable than this project. This record was thrown together in a short amount of time. There are still moments I can return to from this album, but I don't know how much I will.*

To be specific my favorite songs from these groups are chaconne, paradoxxx invasion, fever, +82, badvillain, I mainly pay attention to groups that have harder; detailed dances (e'last, JustB, &team, p1harmony ) as l'm a dancer myself and someone who use to do musical theater I love watching other dancers perform live with the ability to have stable vocals at the same time (this is not to drag black pink in any way, shape, or form but this exact reason is why I'm not a blink though l'll listen to their music every now and then and still respect the girls as a group. ). I blame bts for my pickiness in the groups I like LOL (they were the first kpop group I listened to back in 2016) . I slowly am seeing myself favoring the newer generation groups because they seem to fit my standards in what l'm looking for in a group in a group in order for me to Stan them.

Sure, there are toxic sides to both fandoms, but I see more posts talking about how toxic Stays and Engenes are than actual examples of them being toxic lol. As for the Engenes who comment ""Enhypen is better!!"" under other bg TikToks, those are very obviously trolls. They often comment negative things under Enhyper's tiktok as well. When it comes to Stays, I feel like they usually just mind their own business.

Edit: Nvm stays and engenes really are horrible 😭

unpopularkpopopinions,1l23vet,2025-06-03 07:24:46,Engenes are part of the reason why enhypen growth is stunted both artistically and personally.,"As someone who’s followed enhypen for a while, I’ve noticed that their potential is being held back mainly bcs of their own fandom. Most engenes often go to great lengths to shield the members from any form of criticism, even when that criticism is necessary.

This becomes a real issue when members make fatphobic or racially insensitive remarks, and instead of fans calling it out or encouraging accountability, it’s brushed under the rug with excuses like “they didn’t mean it” or try to justify their actions terrorizing fans that are trying to edicate them. I’ve seen this year’s ago with how they treated black fans to a point they all left because they were calling out one of the members who said the n word. I’m seeing it now as once more we tey to tell them about how horrible are those comments they make about sunoo. Idols are human and can make mistakes but growth doesn’t happen in an echo chamber.

By refusing to hold them accountable or educate them, fans are keeping them in a bubble. And that bubble is costing them. Potential fans especially international ones are turned off not just by the problematic comments themselves, but by the lack of acknowledgment or change afterward. Why would someone want to stan a group if they’re worried they’ll have to deal with casual fatshaming or racism, and a fanbase that defends it?

It’s unpopular to say this because in K-pop fandoms, calling out your own fave is seen as betrayal. But real support isn’t blind praise it’s helping your faves grow so they can do better, be better, and reach a wider audience. Protecting them from all criticism only stunts their growth. I don’t believe enhypen are bad people just in need of educating whoever this whole hate train their receiving its because fans don’t allow people to do so. And that’s costing them heavily so.

unpopularkpopopinions,1j62jy7,2025-03-07 23:45:42,The only REAL victims are ILLIT,"This is an unpopular opinion since fans love victimizing nj, regardless of evidence that has come out contrary of their claims. 

I want to preface this by saying if you disagree with me, rather than downvoting my comment, please reply to me because I genuinely want to hear other perspectives. 

I think as deluded as anyone wants to be about this situation, there’s no denying at all that ILLIT is the real victims of this situation. As someone that was more of a fan of new jeans than illit, the more information that comes out about this case, the shadier new jeans gets. From simply lying about them not bowing, then changing her story to “ told to ignore” it just doesn’t make them look good at all. Everyone loves to make a case for them by saying mhj manipulated them, now to a certain extent that is believable, they are not children. Any average 20 year old should be able to discern simple wrong from right and simply passing the blame onto mhj takes away the whole “accountability” thing kpop fans love raving about. 

At the end of the day, new jeans is the one that’s going on this whole PR tirade grabbing up sympathy points from the public when it benefits them. ILLIT being dragged into the mess is genuinely heartbreaking considering the entire issue to begin with was between new jeans and upper level management. Illit members started getting so much shit from nj fans because of hanni’s false accusation. Now that footage has been released, they’re STILL getting shit from nj fans. 

I truly don’t care which side you take, nj or illit, but the objective truth is that illit has done absolutely nothing wrong, while a case can be made for nj’s wrongdoings. 

And before someone calls me an illit stan or a hybe stan, I can name a grand total of 2 members of illit and the only hybe group I would consider myself to be a fan of is enhypen.

when the song came out, i was not a enhypen girl (still not that much) but i knew they had good stuff. i was on twitter at the time and people were going crazy over it, so i decided to listen. and it was a good song, but that was it. then, at the end of the year i saw some spotify wrappeds of people that listened the song more then a 200 times and i was like WHAT???? don't get me wrong, the song is good. but to this day i don't understand why it was such a big thing when is just a normal song. and people still treat it like is the best song that humans ever created. if you don't agree, please explain why you like it so much

unpopularkpopopinions,1iofjbf,2025-02-13 10:41:47,Enhypen try too hard to look cool,"I think it's quite unpopular, I've been watching Enhypen performances since their debut and I only know of them through their performances since I don't follow any content they post or appear on. In the beginning they all looked a little awkward but almost all new groups do look awkward so it didn't bother me much. But lately, especially with the recent comebacks, it feels like they're trying a little too hard to look cool while performing while having no personality of their own. Jay is the only member who's naturally cool and he brings that vibe to every song he performs, Ni-Ki I believe fits all songs because he's such a good dancer but his expressions remain stoic so ig I'd say he's cool too and Sunoo, while not cool all the time, has a good understanding of the vibe of a song so he kinda adjusts his expressions and movements based on it. Apart from these three everybody else seems to have the same idea of ""looking cool"" which is basically licking their lips at the oddest of times. Part of me feels like the rest of the members are simply aping Heesueng's style of performing which imo has always been too much. Like Heeseung has the tendency to overemphasize movements and words since I-Land and I feel like the rest of them are doing something similar.  
I guess I'll stick to only listening to the songs.

unpopularkpopopinions,1h8zvsk,2024-12-07 20:17:27,"I don't like K-pop songs that are too high, I think it's grating.","I realised this while watching the survival show I-LAND 2. There was a [performance of Panorama](https://youtu.be/llT_8cxkEpA?si=EoYlmlEPmlu9dm7a) and I was suprised to like it because I remembered listening to the original song by IZ\*ONE and disliking it. So I went back to the [IZ\*ONE version](https://youtu.be/G8GaQdW2wHc?si=hTxn5m6ORATqCyOJ) and... yep, still not my thing. And the reason was that in I-LAND 2, there was a story about the key being too high and the judges allowed the trained to lower it.

The opposite happened with Flicker, my favourite original song from I-LAND. I replayed the [performance video](https://youtu.be/souaV9rrBKM?si=RSOj8p_LmVOHsYuu) *a lot*. I was so happy that we would have a studio version by ENHYPEN (the group formed from I-LAND). But I was very disappointed when it turned out that [this version](https://youtu.be/9uazMxm1bmE?si=MioB2iYajnE3hm43) has a higher key and I ended up not liking it as much, like I may not skip it if it comes up on a playlist but I won't go looking for it.

Another evidence is Fake love. It was the first song I heard from BTS and I did *not* become a fan then. Unfortunately for me, because the less I hear it, the better, it was performed in I-land *and* in Boys planet ! 🙃

I think this opinion is unpopular because Panorama and Fake love are well-loved songs. Also people always talk about how hard they are to sing and not how annoying they are (my opinion obviously) so I feel alone in my (bad?) taste. Or maybe my ears are too sensitive ? 🤷‍♀️

unpopularkpopopinions,1fl3oge,2024-09-20 06:18:12,"Enhypen's worst title tracks are Bite Me + Sweet Venom, and Blessed-cursed + Future-perfect are far better","I think this is unpopular because Bite Me is regarded as one of Enhypen's best songs, and people usually have a positive view of Sweet Venom. Meanwhile, Blessed-cursed and Future-perfect are considered as their worst title tracks.

  
I understand why Bite Me is very popular, but I personally don't like the song. The verses are okay, but the ""rap"" part (not sure if that's how you call it) ruins the song for me. I also feel like there's no ""stand out"" part of the song that I really like.

  
Sweet venom doesn't have a part that I really dislike, but the whole song is a bit forgettable to me. I do like the bridge part though.

  
I think the part that is truly unpopular is that I find Blessed-cursed and Future-perfect to be far better than those two songs. I don't distinctly remember why Blessed-cursed was criticized, but the reception generally seemed to be negative. I think it's super catchy and held up really well, and there's not a single part of the song that I dislike.

  
As for Future-Perfect, it was definitely criticized for it's use of autotune. While I understand why some find it grating, I don't mind the effect and I actually think it improves the song. The highlight, for me, is definitely the pre-chorus, which I love.

  
In conclusion, I have a generally negative to indifferent opinion of Bite me and Sweet venom, while I always go back to Blessed-cursed and Future perfect since their releases. I also really enjoy the positive theme and lyrics to the latter two songs.

unpopularkpopopinions,1f2g0no,2024-08-27 14:39:11,relay dances,"I’m pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion because relay dances are never a big deal, I just have specific pet peeves.

But something I don’t like in kpop relay dances is when there are the 3 people who are dancing the chorus or dance break, and then continue to stay and do a part after that bit, even though they have just been in the front and/or center and danced an important part! The same 3 members then take up a whole minute of the song when the others are just stood in the back for half/more than half of the relay dance😭 
Like let’s see all the members in this relay please!

Or when members specifically try to walk back and get in a closer position to the front in the line, even after they’ve just been dancing at the front, to try and get their own parts like please just wait in the line, you’ll get another part to dance don’t worry😭

This is definitely just a random pet peeve of mine but I absolutely hate it I have no idea why. The most recent one that came to mind is Enhypens Brought The Heat Back, where the members dancing the chorus proceed to stay for the parts after that. They didn’t do it for too long, but it’s still just a pet peeve of mine. There are definitely other relay dances that have this in them, I’ve just forgotten off the top of my head but yeah. 

To be fair though I don’t mind when the relay dance is practiced all that much as I LOVE XG’s Woke Up relay. If you haven’t seen it please go watch it it is SO satisfying to see them co-ordinate in sections so well.

That’s my two cents for this week!

unpopularkpopopinions,1eo82bq,2024-08-09 21:04:50,You can't always blame companies for minor injuries,"I think this is unpopular because the usual consensus I see over artist injuries is that it's always the company's fault. Obviously it varies from situation to situation, but I think people are too quick to blame injuries on companies

Take Fifty Fifty, for example. The situation with their ex members was 100% because of ATTRKT's mistreatment. However, what I'm referring to is the news of when idols roll their ankle or have a minor injury and their fans jump to blaming the company. Recently, Moka from Illit got a leg muscle injury and is taking a break from activities to recover, but all the comments and quotes are immediately blaming it on Hybe. Obviously, there's nuance to these cases. Jay from Enhypen is 100% being overworked by Belift with his knee injury because Enhypen has been touring for years without rest and he hardly had time to recover. But I don't think things like Wonhee injuring her foot, NCT's Jisung rolling his ankle, Hyein hurting her leg are anything to be skeptical about. I think we're forgetting that idols are being trained like athletes and practice choreo almost every day. It's normal to get injured from time to time when you're doing physically strenuous activities

Are these injuries more common because of idols being overworked? Yes. But I think it's silly to comment things like ""what's going on in Hybe"" and ""it's getting weird, there's no way they're getting injured casually"" when the work they do 100% makes sense for them to get minor leg injuries every now and then. It just feels weirdly parasocial to me when these idols are being fussed over like moms do when their kids scrape their knee. I feel like it would be even more strange if they just never got injured with all the physical activity they do?

I just think that since his styling and aesthetic has made the switch from the ""young and rich, tall and handsome"" prince of the group to an absolute vampire king he just sticks out like a sore thumb. ZB1 is very much a boy next door kinda group and I feel like Ricky's being styled more for Enhypen's concept.

This is probably an unpopular opinion because he undoubtedly worked very hard to win Boy's Planet and he gets along so well in the group. He's so talented, I just don't know why they want him to look like an anime villain in a group of soft boys. I guess you could argue that his visuals draw in fans who might not be into the overall concept, but I don't think one member having a different aesthetic than the other 8 looks cohesive. (Again, no hate, I'm personally obsessed with his look, I just don't think it fits the rest of the group)

unpopularkpopopinions,1c5mgs6,2024-04-16 19:49:40,"I absolutely hate it when fans go ""... idol has improved so much.""","Firstly dont even get me started on hybe oversaturating the market just debuting kids left and right without any proper training whatsoever. The only training they had was the survival show they debuted off of. And i see people praising these kids like eg of illit saying ""oh iroha improved so much since the show"".

Im not gonna say anything about dance because the whole kpop market has become like of dancers instead of singers as they technically should've been so everyone is on top of that. So everything i say is gonna be about vocals. I also dont dare say anything about 3rd gen because i have nothing to say, they are singers. 

And not just them, i bring this up as its most relevant rn, especially after lesserafim's cochella, many 4th gen idols are praised by fans after some time of debut for ""improving"". But these ""improved"" skills are what they should have debuted with in the first place. I dont expect them do be amazing from the start, some things definitely come from experience. But usually they use it when their ability go from ""barely acceptable"" to ""decent"" which is nothing to celebrate. They should be at least ""quite good"" from the start and when they improve to ""amazing"" is what should be celebrated, like the 3rd gen. Anyone can improve if they do something for sometime which is just normal and nothing special. Say enhypen, the guys were not al all ready for debut, except heesung none of them could even give a decent vocal performance at time time of iland.

If this is the case, then i will say anyone with some connections, is pretty and the producers favour them for some reason can become an idol because unlike vocals, companies later train them for dance. If its the improvement that the fans rave about then there were many other trainees that were much better than the idol at the stage and couldve improved so much more if given the chance which feels so unfair to me. 

Im not saying that improving is a bad thing its good that they do actually but its become a way for people to defend the lacking vocal ability of idols for fans. And i think this is unpopular opinion because ive literally seen no one talk about it.

unpopularkpopopinions,1bes9vp,2024-03-14 19:31:27,Enhypen possesses more potential than Hybe offers,"There I said it. Perhaps it will be an unpopular opinion or not, depends. I think in my opinion why it is unpopular is because we don't promote them as much as we could and they did have their share of controversy n the beginning of their career. I also think Hybe has been giving them the ""shy approach"" by not letting them fully shine. I'd love to see them experimenting more in different genres as they have been so far, and honestly I think their music is rocks. I believe the guys have more hidden talents than Hybe let's them. They've been having long tours so far and not as much collabs as perhaps other groups. I'd even say they have been a bit under the rug with many things, despite being likable and memorable.  
Each single member has something to give and they could potentially grow even more, beyond the Bite Me era. I am pretty aware it's been their third year going fourth since they debuted which is why I think there is room for so much more.  
Our Engene fandom is always a bit reclusive in my eyes, or I may be wrong, about promoting our boys, so I really wanted to say my few crumbs in this.  
What do you folks think? Please be kind and respectful. Thank you.

unpopularkpopopinions,1b4k5kz,2024-03-02 10:13:43,"most 4th gen k-pop idols know how to sing well, but can't properly show off their live vocals because of their companies' decisions","in general, I believe that 4th gen consists of competent & proficient singers given their years of vigorous training. I'm pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion, as I've seen many netizens (mostly X users) criticize idols' radio performances, appearances on American TV, & encores.

let me list down factors that I think limit idols from showcasing their full vocal potention.

1. **songs that are beyond idols' vocal ranges**: there are numerous live performances, mainly encores, in which idols strain &/or go all pitchy. from what I've observed, this is because groups are given songs beyond their current range. (I say ""current"", because idols can learn to expand their vocal ranges over time.)

example: IVE's I Am. while the members are able to more or less reach the song's notes, I feel they force themselves to do so in full voice. My Satisfaction, though, COMPLETELY different story omg. they sound comfortable and healthy singing it. when I first listened to it, I couldn't believe the first girl singing was Wonyoung. her low notes are seriously underutilized!

2. **streneous choreographies**: it isn't fair to claim that idols can't sing when their choreographies involve jumping, popping, or quickly changing positions, among other intense moves. one can argue that Jungkook or Western artists like Beyoncé or Bruno Mars are able to sing while dancing tiring routines, but they're exceptions in the (mainstream) industry. because performers are human, they lose their breath and get tired too.

example: NewJeans' Ditto and Super Shy. in their behind the scenes recording footage, anyone can tell their songs were written especially for them. their voices are stable and clean, and just overall sound very well taken care of.

both choreos for these songs have the members constantly moving, which means their voices would obviously shake or deviate from the right notes. maybe with more training and performing, NewJeans can find the right technique to keep their vocals stable even when dancing, but they only just debuted recently. they're doing great for an almost 2-year old group!

3. **the combination of hard songs & hard dances**: this is a mix of the first and second factors above. sometimes, groups have to perform incredibly high (and low?) songs that also have equally challenging choreographies.

example: ENHYPEN's Drunk-Dazed and Tamed-Dashed. forgive me if I come across as biased (or if I'm just straight up biased as enha's my ult group lol), but those boys can surely dance, aight. the Drunk-Dazed choreo, unfortunately, barely has any room for rest, which compromises the members' vocals and results in their lip-syncing &/or cracking.

on the other hand, ENHYPEN's recent comeback albums, Dark Blood and Orange Blood, not only make use of the members' individual vocal ranges, but also highlight their dance skills. in Sweet Venom, we get to hear the guys comfortably singing in falsetto instead of their usual belting. in Criminal Love, though not a part of the albums I mentioned, I think is worth pointing out for its charm of balancing Ni-ki's low notes and Heeseung's high notes, as well as highlighting the members' dance dynamics.

to put the cherry on top, the choreographies of their recent songs are not as aggressive as their past songs. I'm gonna use Sweet Venom as an example again. the dance is relatively easy for the members and even gives them opportunities to sing live well, and improvise moves to match their individual styles of dancing. though one of their chiller dances, Sweet Venom is still very entertaining to watch. it even has a short, but sweet dance break where we are able to catch the members give their all if we weren't already satisfied with the verses &/or choruses' routines.

4. **complacency**: idols are more than just talented. they're passionate and disciplined — the ideal formula in any career field imo. they don't strike me as rebels. I'm certain they listen to and work hard to learn from their voice teachers, but their voice teachers might be teaching them too little or too quickly. (sorry if this sounds vague! I don't know how else to express my thoughts for this one eheh.)

these teachers might also be satisfied with the bare minimum just to be able to pump out more music at a fast pace, resulting in idols voices being underdeveloped.

example: ITZY's Untouchable. I'd say the song suits the group's concept and its active members' ranges; however, they seem to get overwhelmed when singing live. in their Kiss Radio performance of Untouchable, whenever they attempt to harmonize with one another, they hesitate on which notes they're meant to sing.

5. **lack of positions**: I've always thought that part of the reason for BTS' success is that they have their own strengths. together, they make a team that perfectly balances one another out. Seventeen is also a great example that share these same dynamics.

for some reason, 4th gen idols have to be all-rounders/aces, even though it's okay and I'd even argue, better to not be! more vocally challenging lines should be given to main vocalists, less difficult lines should be given to sub-vocalists. it's the same with dancing. if it means giving less lines to sub-vocalists, then companies ought to take advantage of albums as a whole & even out line distributions. of course, there can be exceptions to this rule for as long as the idols have a say in the lines they're given.

I might think of more, but right now, these 5 considerations are what's on the top of my head.

TLDR: most 4th gen k-pop idols know how to sing, & can sing well. their skills don't show live, however, because their companies give songs that are too high/low, make choreos too intense, and fail to take advantage of positions.

unpopularkpopopinions,18akmm5,2023-12-04 14:51:27,I don’t like “extra” award show performances,"(By extra I mean when groups spice up their performances by adding extra choreography and stuff at the beginning of the performance before delving into the main choreography we all know and we’ve seen before) 


I know this is an unpopular opinion because K-pop fans really like award show performances and look forward to these year-end award show performances annually. They also look forward to how groups are going to make the choreography “different” by adding extra elements. 

Personally I really don’t care for them.  Half of the time I’m waiting for the main performance to start. All the extra choreo and stuff they usually add to the performances before the main choreo of whatever song they’re performing annoy me lol. Most of the time I’m fast forwarding to get to the main thing. This is why performance videos and music shows are my favorite thing cause it’s just the undiluted choreography with no added razzle-dazzle. The type of award show performances I like are the ones where groups collab and cover dances from their seniors. Like when the 4th gen GGs did twice last year or when txt and enhypen covered some iconic boy group dances. Those were amazing imo. 

It’s different if groups have different choreo or different vocal arrangements or a live band but all these weirdly placed dance breaks just don’t do it for me lol 

I’ve only enjoyed very few “extra” award show performances and those are Itzy MAMA 2021, Le sserafim MMA 2022 and Twice golden disk awards 2020. Trying to see if any from this awards show season will enter the list

unpopularkpopopinions,17unzmn,2023-11-14 00:15:33,Groups without Positions Absolutely Have Positions,"As the title states, groups that don't have any official positions still function as if the members have traditional K-pop positions. The only exceptions I can think of are, ironically, groups that formerly did have official positions: Stray Kids and SEVENTEEN. I know a lot of people enjoy the lack of positions in more recent K-pop groups, so this may be an unpopular opinion for them, but I have to break it to y'all: these groups still operate the exact same way as a second-gen group with minute differences to line and formation distribution.

RIIZE is what tipped me over the edge here. Their only ""official"" positions are that Shotaro is the eldest, Eunseok is the visual, Wonbin is the center, and Anton is the maknae. However, across their four tracks so far, this is clearly the positions they've all been handed:

* Shotaro: main dancer, lead rapper, sub-vocalist
* Eunseok: lead rapper, sub-vocalist, visual
* Sungchan: main rapper, sub-vocalist, visual, face of the group
* Wonbin: main dancer, lead vocalist, sub-rapper, visual, center
* Seunghan: lead dancer, lead vocalist, sub-rapper
* Sohee: main vocalist, lead dancer, sub-rapper
* Anton: sub-rapper, sub-vocalist, maknae

Sohee gets the most lines by far and quite a bit of center time. Seunghan and Wonbin are given quite a few singing lines as well, though not as much as Sohee. Anton's lines are mostly through ad-libs and filler, but he's usually on par with the previous two just from that. Eunseok and Sungchan may get two singing lines and Shotaro usually gets one or none.

Sungchan gets the most rap lines, followed by Shotaro, and Eunseok barely edges out everyone else; personally, I don't think they knew what to do with him aside from ""handsome guy behind the others.""  
Wonbin gets the most center time, but Shotaro is usually given the spotlight during more complex choreo (i.e. Siren). Seunghan is usually paired with those two in dance line formations, but Sohee has really shown off his competence while dancing. There's a gap between him and Sungchan and Eunseok and an even bigger gap leading to Anton.

Point is, it's quite clear how SM is using these members, despite having a total of two/four actual positions. There's a similar problem with TOMORROW X TOGETHER under Big Hit:

* Soobin: leader, lead dancer, sub-rapper, sub-vocalist
* Yeonjun: main dancer, main rapper, sub-vocalist, face of the group
* Beomgyu: lead dancer, sub-rapper, sub-vocalist, visual, center
* Taehyun: main vocalist, sub-rapper
* Heuning Kai: lead rapper, lead vocalist, visual, maknae

And ENHYPEN under BE:LIFT, despite me not agreeing at all with how they utilize the members talent-wise:

* Jungwon: lead dancer, lead vocalist, sub-rapper, visual
* Heeseung: main dancer, main vocalist, lead rapper
* Jay: lead dancer, lead rapper, sub-vocalist
* Jake: lead vocalist, sub-rapper
* Sunghoon: sub-rapper, sub-vocalist, visual
* Sunoo: sub-rapper, sub-vocalist, visual, face of the group
* NI-KI: main dancer, main rapper, sub-vocalist, maknae

I assume you all get where I'm going here.

All you need to do is pay attention to the line distribution (of vocals and rap separately), choreography formations, center time and focus in promotional materials, and some basic mathematics based on number of members in each group and it's very clear who slots into what spot. If line distributions were incredibly even or if talents were all around the same level, I wouldn't even be making this post. Unfortunately, this has become a trend that's completely unrealistic and unfounded. Either all groups have positions (as all groups and bands across modern musical history have) or none do.

unpopularkpopopinions,17d6z3n,2023-10-21 18:54:02,2023 has been an outstandingly bad year for music in kpop,"I think this an unpopular opinion, as a lot of people has been having a good time with the releases this year, I do however think it's been pretty god damn terrible.

Lack of interesting debuts: 

We have had a remarkably different year compared to last year when we talk about debuts in 2023. Since 2022 had SO many highly anticipated, and wildly popular debuts, 2023 stands in very sharp contrast. While the girl group debuts has been close to non-existant (with only kiss of life and Limelight be memorable), the boy group debuts has been just.. meh? Most groups has debuted with such whatever songs, and none has managed to get much traction at all (Riize being the only real exception and IN MY OPINION it's the big 4 advantage, not because the songs are good)

Established groups releasing very tired songs:

While Kitsch is my favourite IVE track, I realise this is not the average opinion. IVEs releases are simply not as popular this year, not bad songs, but I AM is just not on the level of Love Dive, and their recent release has fallen even more, even though I actually enjoy Baddie, it's objectively just not up to par for their releases.

Somi was my biggest disappointment of the year.

Everglow was highly anticipated, has fallen far.

AKMUs recent release was just.. it hurts my heart.

Taeyang getting some good features on his songs with Lisa and Jimin, but boy did they disappoint. 

TxT just can't seem to find the magic from Lovesong era.

Twices views are plumpeting and also honestly so is the quality.

Nayeons solo was so fucking catchy, Jihyo's was somewhat uninspired.

ITZY. (Japanese release good tho)

DON'T KILL ME, Haeguem is just low budget daechwita, all Jungkooks new music is so average western pop, V definitely has a sound, I just don't enjoy it. Jimin did good.

Jisoos debut was just the most boring one of the Blackpink girls. 

What are nct 127 even doing at this point

NewJeans are doing extremely well, but I despise drum and bass, and unfortunately that's 99% of their discography

Rover is so much worse than peaches and mmh

While I seriously enjoy BONA BONA, it just seems like an attempt to recreate BlackPinks successful songs

Nmixx changed their entire sound to something more mainstream, not enjoying this 

While Bite Me is my absolute favourite Enhypen song ever, most people actually dont like it??? It's extremely cringe, but I'm unapologetic so

Gidle did good.

I'm probably forgetting a lot of groups.. also please don't kill me, no hate is meant by any of this, it's just frustration as I love so many of these groups, and I'm so disappointed by the uninspired way K-pop is going

unpopularkpopopinions,16kpw86,2023-09-17 05:04:04,Songs without a bridge/not typical song structure always feel lacking and incomplete,"I just listened to ""Back for More"" by TXT and wanted to say that I initially absolutely LOVED it. It was so catchy and was definitely my style of music.

But when I realized they didn't have a bridge, I immediately lost a little bit of interest in the song. When I say typical song structure I mean your usual (with PreChorus and Intro being the only ones I'll consider optional):

Intro, Verse 1, Pre-chorus, Chorus, Verse 2, PC, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus

That bridge is especially one that I am nitpicky over. Just having two verses and a chorus feels extremely empty and lacking. This has always been the case for me too. Other examples I can think of are: Sugar Rush Ride (TXT), Alone (Highlight), Danger (BTS), and Blessed-Cursed (ENHYPEN)

As you can see, this doesn't limit to ""short"" songs either. It's not like I will hate the song or anything, but they lose a significant amount of interest for me if they miss that bridge! I have a feeling this is extremely unpopular though, simply because it's a minor nitpick and others probably don't even care xd

unpopularkpopopinions,15zw7m6,2023-08-24 10:48:40,Lesserafim's visuals are lacking,"EDIT : GUYS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THEIR LOOKS!

When it comes to music videos, performance videos, other clips- kpop can be very competitive. And I feel like Lesserafim is trotting behind in that department. I think it's unpopular because I haven't seen conversations about it. 

I watched all their mvs and they do get better little by little with time. Antifragile has an asteroid arc and unforgiven has a fallen angel arc. Regardless, they mostly share similarities with fearless in the sense that we have a lot of beauty shots and mostly clips of them dancing. Their bsides music videos are glorified dance videos and add nothing to their cinematography. The biggest takeaway I have with their mvs are that the members are there to be looked at. In retrospect , it doesn't suprise me that fearless mv had so many people accusing it of being for the male gaze because their mvs feel ultimately aimless.

While that's not the end of the world, and that a lot of lesser known groups' mvs are like this, other groups of their caliber have developed a strong visual language - either by incorporating lore or a story, or by having a distinctive style and cinetography to them. Lesserafim is supposed to have lore , their debut and first two comebacks are a trilogy, but you wouldn't guess that in the music videos.

Hybe groups in particular have strong visual languages that are unique to them. Bts, txt, enhypen, and of course New jeans whose visuals are always praised and have revolutionised how the industry treats music videos. Aespa have the smcu episodes  supposed to explain their lore. Itzy has a style to their mvs that is just so very itzy, it's hard to explain. Lesserafim have none of that. 

I understand they're being minimalist, but I feel like there is a lack of cohesion between their mvs, and that their mvs feel like they have nothing to do with the music. They're just there to look pretty, and while they are all gorgeous of course, they could do so much more with the ressources they have. I don't see creative effort into creating a style that is proper to them

unpopularkpopopinions,15n6ifm,2023-08-10 10:34:04,Somi's Fast Forward is super good and KPOP needs more club music,"I was quite surprised when I heard the chorus for Fast Forward. At first I was underwhelmed, but that's how it is when the chorus' main focus is the beat and beat drop. So I grew to love it pretty quickly. The chorus is by no means bad or boring.

I wouldn't consider Fast Forward to be fully club music but it's club music-like. I think it would be awesome for KPop groups to have at least 1 club song on their albums. They're fun and can get stuck in your head. 

Another example of club music in KPop is Go Big or Go Home by Enhypen. Mostly because of the part where there's a dance break. Just imagine how fun the Kpoo scene would be with more songs like Fast Forward and Go Big or Go Home. It'd be great for the fans that go to see them live. And it's just great in general as it's something to put on when cleaning your room or going to the gym. 

I'm sure there's more songs similar to what I just talked about (give me some recs if you want) so I don't wanna act like Somi or Enhypen are the first to do it. But yeah I'm a big advocate for more music like what Somi just put out in the KPop scene. I think this is unpopular because there's not enough club music in Kpop and because I think we're too focused on groups maintaining their concept rather than just making good and fun music.

as for other members, i feel like none of them has the sense or rhythm or style or dynamic or should i say they have no flow with poor dictation. just a good tone is not enough to be a rapper so i hope hybe would train them more if they wish to give them more rap parts in their songs.

but overall i think hybe should focus on their vocal more instead of giving them rap parts in a song like not every song requires a rap part and like i said above i don't think rapping is their forte at all.

Most fans don't like shipping idols, but I consider all the random ""they're like siblings omg"" compilations as annoying, if not more. It basically became a sort of legalized shipping, people won't cringe and critizise it as much, on the contrary most of this content receives praise. Assuming someone else's relationship when the party involved said nothing about it is pretty weird.

This post steams in particular from a live I watched where SVT Hoshi was asked about various groups, among them there was Enhypen and he answered that he can't say much about them because he meets them only for work (at least at the time of this live which is around a year old) at the end he even said he doesn't really have too many friends in the industry so they should stop asking him about other groups lol. And I realized that even though they might've had tiktok collabs or despite working in the same building, it doesn't mean they have any sort of personal relationship while most fans think that Hybe artists are like a big family.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the content in itself because it's basically fanfictions in form of videos, but it's the reaction to them that is wrong imo People just believe that what they see is true and assume that those two people are actually real friends.

A bit beside the point, but I also hate with all my heart the mom/dad dynamic or ""omg X raised Y so well"" when these people are only a couple of years apart at most. In this case I also consider idols within the same group because this is where this happens the most. Saying Jin raised Jk or that Bang Chan is skz's dad just makes me cringe so hard. Like the joke is fun the first time, but people repeating it and truly believing that is how their relationship works is just ugh

unpopularkpopopinions,142mpy7,2023-06-06 19:17:14,Newjeans isn’t only popular because they are under Hybe Labels,"Let’s get onto it. I notice under so many posts about Newjeans are passive aggressive points towards them claiming the group wouldn’t be as ‘popular’ without Hybe. While this may be the case for other groups. Here’s why this opinion is simply not true when it comes to Newjeans (in my opinion). I think this opinion is unpopular cause many would say that Newjeans is in fact only popular because of Hybe but here’s why I disagree.

Let’s firstly get started with the fact that other groups debut under HYBE have not reached Newjeans success apart from BTS. Le SSerafim, Enhypen and Boy Next Door didn’t come close(I adore those groups but they haven’t reached the level of Newjeans yet)

Newjeans went big because of their refreshing concepts and visuals. It really wasn’t because of anything else. I don’t think that it’s mainly HYBE but more so the fact their concept was a breath of fresh air at the time.

Many compared Newjeans to early 2000’s group and I couldn’t agree more but considering that’s what trendy now in 2023, and upon their debut of course they blew up.Newjeans simply happened to come out at the right time and place and while some say they got ‘lucky’. I’ll admit if it wasn’t for debuting under HYBE they probably would’ve still made it big. The group has visuals and fun concepts so it was bound to happen.

Obviously I understand it’s their opinions but I feel like I’m the only one that actually really enjoyed it. I feel it builds up toward the chorus more, yet others have edited the anti drop to be after the chorus because they think it ruins the buildup from the ‘oh my oh my god’ part.

Was wondering what everyone’s opinions about it on here are, since I haven’t seen much on Reddit about it yet (unless I’m perhaps living under a rock and people have already discussed this).

unpopularkpopopinions,13v52kv,2023-05-29 22:07:52,A group having Lore or a Set Concept is unnecessary for enjoyment,"I'll preface this with the fact that I started out in kpop in early 2nd Gen before either of these were really a thing. So that may be clouding my bias here!

I don't care about a group having lore, even if they're one of my favorite groups. For instance, I love aespa's music but I genuinely don't care at all about their storyline and lore, I just like the MVs and the music. Another example, I like some of TXT's songs and their MVs are very visually compelling, but I don't care to find out how they connect to one another and what story is being portrayed overall. The only exceptions to this are the groups who have done a trilogy of lore, like Dreamcatcher with Scream-Boca-Odd Eye but while I enjoyed the connection between the three I still am not going to go out of my way to understand all the theories and nuance behind it all.

As for a set concept, I actually dislike this idea. Back in 2nd and 3rd gen, you kind of never knew what you were going to get. VIXX wasn't stuck in a set concept and so when they pulled off anything and everything beautifully, it just made for a great one-off (pr trilogy in some cases) of a story told through the MV for a great song. Then they moved on to the next story and song, etc. I enjoyed that much more than, say, knowing that a group's concept is to be vampires and every single one of their MV plays into that. 

Now, there are well done concepts, I am not knocking that, but I just think they're unnecessary. For instance, I get far more excited for a Seventeen or WOODZ comeback because I can't know what I'm going to get, vs. a Kingdom or ENHYPEN comeback. Those latter two will be good, yes, but I know what concept and lore they'll be doing and that makes it all feel a little boring in my opinion (even though I am a fan of both groups). I wish they had more freedom to release a song like, sat, Drunk-Dazed and then their next comeback be a song like SVT World. But their concepts/lore don't allow it.

I believe that this opinion is unpopular because I see a lot of fans complain when I group does not have lore or a set concept that they stick to. It's been specifically used against Kep1er as ""they are flops because they don't have a set concept"", etc. And I have also seen several posts in this community recently about how groups are boring without the set concept or lore.

Again, there is nothing wrong with liking lore/set concept, but for me it is just more fun to let them be artists and not stick them to one set thing.

unpopularkpopopinions,130rxax,2023-04-27 17:33:59,Fans are obsessed with individuality for no reason,"Recently a lot of people shared their opinion on how Blackpink is successful because of their individual activities and how LSF is doing well to allow each member to build their own personal career.

While I agree that this could be a good strategy, I don't think this is always the best strategy to gain success. Think of groups like BTS, Twice or SVT, most of their success (if not all their success) comes from the power they have as a team. They do have their own solo/sub-unit activities and they're very successful at them but I wouldn't say that Twice got more popular thanks to ""Pop"" or that BTS got bigger thanks to Jimin. I'd say it's the other way round, they were successful because they are part of beloved groups. 

I think this kind of discourse can be applied to NJ too, more than individuality, it seems they're focused on giving the image of a united and harmonized group and it's working. Other big 4th gen groups like Aespa or Itzy or Enhypen aren't very focused on inidviduality either. TXT has this weird approach where one member seems to have more solo activities, but still I'd consider them as a group that doesn't focus too much on individuality.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the members shouldn't have solo activities (I'm the first one who begs for more solo works for Twice) but that having a lot of solo activities doesn't necessarily make you more popular. I'd also add that to go solo you need to be ready. LSF have two members that have experience as idols, one of them is basically a senior with years and years of experience. Yunjin likes to make music and her personality makes her stand out, while the other two members don't do anything that other idols in other groups already do (aka modelling or having MC roles), as far as I know.

I consider this as an unpopular opinion because a lot of people think it's better to focus less on the group and give more space to each members' individual career.

unpopularkpopopinions,12ple0r,2023-04-17 17:28:29,Over-dancing is Worse Than Under-dancing,"This is unpopular because, for one, I've never seen any talking about this topic. Usually, people will see someone giving all their energy and think they're going ""so hard"" (in a good way), but they actually look very unorganized and uncoordinated. 

In some cases, over-dancing is just as bad, if not worse than under-dancing. I would rather see someone giving 70% in a dance, than giving over 200%. And I don't want to get this confused with people who actually give it their all while dancing (perfect coordination, in-sync footwork, high yet stable energy,) and people who are doing too much (going faster than the rest of the group, moves are overdramatized, their dancing so hard that it looks sloppy). Also, if they're not in sync with the rest of the group's percentage in dancing, then it throws the whole balance off. Also, I find people to dance too hard to give off ""secondhand embarrassment"". 

One example would be Soul from P1Harmony. While I think he is a good dancer, there have been numerous times that he just overdid it. I went to both their tours in America and during those tours, they will have a little dance break for him, which both dance breaks I look away cause I get a bit of secondhand embarrassment. He does this trick where he goes to the ground to perform a move, but it's so sloppy. It looks like he just falls straight down on the floor. He also tries dancing super fast, and it doesn't work for him (IMO obviously). It's very clumsy-like. Almost like a fish out of water. Same when he dances with them in a group, he's the one person who seems to be out dancing all of them (and NOT in a good way). He overdramatizes his moves to the point it looks like his making fun of the dance. 

Someone who I feel gives a lot of energy but doesn't overdo it -- Niki from Enhypen. He gives great energy, great coordination, does the dance perfectly to a T, and gives the energy that is needed, whilst not giving too much or too less. 

I'm very curious to see what others have to say. For one, can over-dancing be worse than under-dancing? Is there any other idol you feel might belong in this argument? (I'm curious to see)

unpopularkpopopinions,12188en,2023-03-25 03:52:19,survival shows should stop depending on public votes,"Pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion since fans will not be able to vote for their favs, however:

I am currently following the show boysplanet and it's my 3rd time watching a survival show.

the first show i watched was I-Land where there were also votes by the public so fans could support their favs and secure them a spot in the debut line up. I do not remember the entire system but i remember that the producers and also the contestants themselves sometimes elected who they wanted to stay. I think even though this show did rely on public votings the final line up and concept of the group enhypen turned out pretty solid. But nonetheless every watcher of the show knows how much suffering viewers and contestants went through because of certain votes and also drops in rankings etc etc. Also i hace to say enhypen's concept started out a lot stronger than they are now.

Now, the second show i watched was gp999 and this was the first time that this opinion really developed. It was so frustrating that certain very very talented trainees kept getting eliminated and their chances stolen away from them while 2-3 contestants would always receive millions of votes because of their popularity and let's be real: their visuals. Now don't get me wrong, Kep1er's line up isn't bad any means but the issue is the 9 members definitely do not fit in the same concepts which is why their discography up to know has been a bit of a chaos. They do not have a proper identity as a group. that's because they got voted for individually and trying to create a balanced group in the public vote format is pretty much impossible.

Just how things went down with gp999 things are very likely also gonna happen with bep1er, the contestants all have individual fan bases and no one really cares (or well could even care) for creating a balanced final group. I think compared to Kep1er, this time they might already have a set concept for the final group (bc they saw what happened last time) but since no one knows what it is and again, fans are voting, it's not gonna work out any better.
Also, I remember at the start of the show i was very excited for the final line up because of the many talented trainees but now that the line up is sort of already obvious, i am pretty bored since as always looks apparently matter way more than talent to people. (I dont think the very popular trainees are talentless but some of them do not bring as much to the table as other low ranked trainees do)

The reason the produce groups were so successful even though they had fan votes was bc they were rigged, wether you like that fact or not. A team of people very likely properly sat down had a concept in mind and picked the perfect contestants.

Now i don't condone rigging, which is why i think public votes should definitely not be completely disregarded since the groups need to include members people like but i think having maybe 1 or 2 (not continous ones just maybe over the course of a few days) in an entire show is enough and producers and other experts should be the ones electing the ranks within the show. Popularity should not equal a trainees rank in the show.

unpopularkpopopinions,11f1wci,2023-03-01 12:56:56,Enhypen's debut song didn't hit off as a debut song," So first of all, I'm an engene too. But when I first heard Given-Taken, it didn't have the aura of a debut song? I'm not sure if I can get my point across completely but it felt like any other song from their discography. I'm not saying that it's bad, it definitely was a really really good song. But it didn't have the specialty that most debut songs have. It didn't give me the reason that would set them apart from other groups which debut songs usually do. It felt like a song that could have probably been released as any of their other album title tracks. 

Most people absolutely loved it and no doubt it was a great song but it didn't have the feel of a GREAT start if you guys get what I mean. I felt like the hype was for nothing to be honest. Honestly they could have probably had a much better song as their debut than a song which was a rather generic enha song. Is it only me?

I think this is unpopular because alot of people seem to enjoy pass the mic but I think it's their worst song so far.

I still think given taken was the best title track, everything was perfect. I LOVE drunk dazed and the album was amazing but I don't think it was better than given taken apart from the album's b sides ( they were so good).

Now after this Is when things get iffy. I actually really liked tamed dashed it's one of my favourite songs from them but i have a few problems. 

1) why do they all sound the same when we know they don't usually? I think this is more of a big hit problem with the processing but it's darn annoying. What makes kpop interesting is getting to hear different vocal colours shine in songs.

2) The names that are chosen for their title tracks are definitely a choice. Doing this random two words together thing will not last.

Then, blessed cursed and press the mic is when I started actually disliking the tracks as I feel they sound like any other boy group now

1) With blessed cursed, I think the chorus is strong but the rest of the song feels bland and generic.

2) Why are they rapping? I thought the appeal was that they were all goof singers, they are a singing group. Sure there's nothing wrong with experimenting but I still feel like these songs would sound better without rap.

3) With press the mic, I only like the chorus. Nothing else sticks out to me apart from the drill beat which was actually pretty fire.

4) in both these videos I am NOT liking the styling. Its generic and random and I hate it.

We should be going up in terms of quality not down.

unpopularkpopopinions,114yugv,2023-02-17 22:58:46,I think 4th gen SHOULD have started in 2020 and not 2017-2018 and the only reason it started that early was because stans/companies knew the newer groups could never compete with the current 3rd gen,"The title basically summarised it. If we look at how kpop is mostly ggs but still bgs too(I'll focus on ggs more tho) It's obvious that the newer slew of ggs(aespa, ive, njs, lssrfim) are doing better than the older slew of ggs(fromis9, itzy, idle).

I'm not saying itzy is flopping or not doing well I mean they sell 1M for their albums and idle had an incredible year with tomboy and nude so don't get me wrong there

There really isn't that much difference between idle/itzy as compared to the other 3rd gen ggs present at that time and there really wasn't any need to create or for a new gen to pop up. 3rd gen was still going strong like 2017-2019 were some of the best years for 3rd gen.

I think the reason why 4th gen was created that early or considered that early for both bgs and ggs was that there was no way that the groups that debuted at that time would be able to compete with bp or twice or RV. I mean bts was in full force and growing higher, bp just released d4 and twice won a daesang for the third year in a row. There was no way the boyz, itzy, idle, skz or txt would have been able to compete/survive or make their own name if they were in the same gen hence why 4th gen started.

And the start of ""x group is the first 4th gen group to do this"" because without that 4th gen attached those achievements wouldn't really stand. As compared to 2020-now with groups like aespa, ive, njs, lssrfim and possibly baemon where now 3rd gen(excluding bp) has slowed down and the newer 4th gen groups are all the buzz and rave and are creating new achievements with and without the 4th gen attached to it.

Obviously, I'm not saying that the newer 4th gen groups have more impact that bp ,rv or twice BUT they are able to have insane records(spotify listeners, sales, charting on kcharts and intlly) that can compare with 3rd gen groups

There's a clear difference IMO between groups like lssrfim/ive/njs as compared to 3rd gen ggs in terms of concept and vibe than itzy/fromis9/idle as compared to 3rd gen ggs. I think with bgs it's even more severe cause BTS, SVT and NCT are still in full force and while there are some achievements made by some bgs(skz, txt and enhypen) most times it's still tied to the ""first in 4th gen"".

I think this is unpopular because most times people say 4th gen started because it was time(like in terms of how many years each gen lasts) or that there was a difference in terms of music or concept etc etc

unpopularkpopopinions,1061g46,2023-01-07 23:19:30,I-LAND is the best survival show despite its ambiguous ethics,"I am a massive fan of survival shows. I love seeing potential members interact prior to their debut and I have always been curious about what idols are *really* like, personality-wise. Because I was a casual listener of Enhypen's songs I thought I'd give I-LAND a try and boy did it deliver.

It's come to my attention that Enhypen were deeply traumatized by the structure of the show. Into the I-land as a song literally invokes a fight or flight response in them and they don't like talking about the show. The show itself was of course a way to quickly improve the trainees' abilities, as all survival shows are, but what's special about it is its quite honestly sadistic structure. Every week you know someone will leave and you're sad because for the past week you've all bonded only for one of you to leave. Yet, you can't help but want your friends that dropped out to come back. But of course this can't happen unless a few other friends drop out or even you yourself if you've under-performed. It's... genius???

I just can't help but appreciate the insane entertainment value this structure offered. The small cast of trainees only heightened all the drama, since even if they weren't close before they definitely grew close throughout the show. The fact that a lot of the eliminations boiled down to the trainees' opinions and strategies was amazing: it put them in a situation where they both want high chances to debut, while also think critically of the team as a whole. It problematized wanting to stay safe when at the same time you'd like your final teammates to be good enough. It's so good!

Another benefit of the show was the focus on team dynamics: many episodes' elimination number was dictated by how well the team performed which upped the stakes significantly. The small number of trainees allowed for leadership mistakes and communication among everyone on the show, leading to satisfying redemption arcs. Not to mention how much better the trainees were from the get-go compared to other shows.

So yeah. Of course the personalities of the trainees come into play, as well, I think 99% of I-landers were just generally awesome, talented and entertaining people who miraculously seemed to cope quite well all things considered. I love the show, but just can't help but cringe at that fact when I remember how  emotional everyone was when they were handed a phone to make a call to their families.

unpopularkpopopinions,104nr86,2023-01-06 08:15:00,k-pop performances are getting so boring and are just a beauty pageant these days,"edit to add: YES i do respect ateez and stayc lives they are awesome but the fact that they are the only groups brought up when talking about live performances sort of proves my point


where’s the live singing? even some choreo that isn’t difficult gets completely lip synced (yeah a super loud backtrack IS lip syncing) groups are just full of visual members and the singers either are not good or don’t have the confidence to sing live and resultantly sound bad - attractive people are made into singers (e.g. wonyoung) when it probably should be the other way around (e.g. winter)


even when idols sing with the backtrack it is so quiet you can barely hear them, i’m tired of performance after performance of the same backtrack or edited pre-recording


the direction of k-pop has definitely gone towards visuals (yes old k-pop groups looked good but nothing compared to today) and dance performances, so much so that you can audibly tell when weak vocals have been edited to sound better (looking at you enhypen, songs are still catchy though lol) anyway i’ve devolved, stuff is edited to be too perfect and it’s boring, i might as well watch a dance group perform because what’s the point if a music group doesn’t ever sing live

edited to add i think this opinion is unpopular because 4th gen and some 3rd gen stan’s are obsessed with their idols who perform “live” and their vocals are so “stable” and will endlessly defend them or overlook the lip syncing because it is all they know

The tamed- dashed instrumental is a silent killer. It is absolutely amazing. The instrumental really isnt even that noticeable which is whats so qeird about this whole thing.

I was listening to tamed dashed for MONTHS and i just realized how amazing the instrumental was like 2 hours ago. 

The instrumental is entirely different from the vocals itself and it has a completely different vibe from the actual song its self. 

The vocals and the instrumental is like peanut butter and jelly. It shouldnt work but it does. 

It works magnificently well and it literally scratches my brain in places that i didnt even know needed scratching.

unpopularkpopopinions,ylkszn,2022-11-04 02:14:04,"The way Hybe makes music is terrible, and no the problem isn’t the voice filter","I dislike the way Hybe lyricists writes songs, how the producers makes instrumentals, the way the songs are cut short, and how generic it is. I think this is unpopular because if someone says their music is bad then you only see people saying that the voice filter is the problem. Plus, last time I tried to bring this up I got heavily downvoted.

I find their music to be incredibly repetitive bits such  “Good boy gone bad good boy gone good boy gone bad x10” “Anti-ti-ti-ti-ti fragile Anti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti fragile” “Hot Hot Hot feeling so hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot” While making this opinion I am listening to their songs to see if I want to give them a second chance, and I don’t think my opinion will change. I don’t get how the voice filter is noted as the worst thing when I find these other problems to be worse. 

The final choruses have nothing behind them, it’s always the same as all the other ones. The songs don’t ever sound THAT bad, I quite like the foundation of them if that makes sense, but when the final chorus comes on and I realize that it barely sounds different or it sounds the exact same like it was copy and pasted I just feel so disappointed and I want to skip. The verses always sound the same too. I think even the songs I just mentioned have the potential to be good. I just find them annoying. The songs get stuck in my head, but not in a way that makes me want to listen to them. I was someone who would confidently tell you that Hybe makes the best music out of all the companies, perfect company, but I can’t say that anymore. The last time I actually liked a release from them was a year ago and three of my (or former) ult groups are under their company, but I find the music to consistently be bad nowadays to the point of where I have little to no hope for them. It’s not just the title tracks, it’s the b-sides. Of course this isn’t EVERY song. I do think that Hybe at their best nowadays is just good, but at their worst it makes me skip the song in 5 seconds.

Another reason why I find the songs boring is because they’re plain and generic to me. I feel this part is a bit controversial because it feels the popular opinion is “TXT is making music different from the rest of the 4th gen boy groups.” “Nobody is making music like NewJeans.” “Seventeen is nothing like other boy groups.” something like that, and while I’m not saying their music doesn’t sound different from other groups, I think that in the grand scheme of things their music isn’t anything new and a bit plain. Anti-fragile is different for k-pop, but it’s just another genre sung in Korean. Afro-latin or reggaeton music isn’t new, they’re just singing it in Korean and making it a bit more pop. TXT’s newest title track honestly sounds like a generic 4th gen boygroup to me, but the rest of the album is something you would honestly hear on the radio. Seventeen’s Hot also sounds like a typical boy group to me. The b-sides do sound a bit more unique to me(except Ash and If You Leave Me) but I think they suffer from all the other problems I mentioned such. NewJeans isn’t anything new, it’s just R&B with some pop elements. Pass the Mic isn’t new, it’s drill music. It’s not new or groundbreaking to just take other genres, sing it in Korean, touch it up to make it more pop, and that’s it. 

By the way, this is mostly about Seventeen, Le Sserafim, kinda BTS, TXT, kinda Newjeans, and Enhypen. I don’t know really anything about Fromis_9 or their other artists.

I’m definitely not saying all the songs are bad. Some songs that I think aren’t bad (even if they might follow somewhat of the same structure or have some of the same problems I listed) are Don Quixote, Shadow, Hype Boy, Attention, Run BTS & Impurities.

For more songs I think follow the same formula(or have a lot of elements of it) is Yet to Come, Permission to Dance, Darling, ParadoXXX Invasion, Fearless, No Celestial, March, Bout You, Circles, Opening Sequence, & Thursday’s Child. And to say this again, I am not talking about all of the music to ever be released under Hybe. This is mostly music from around mid 2021 to now or early 2021 to now.

Edit: PLEASE stop trying to paint me as an anti or someone who is just hating to hate. I don’t hate any of the groups mentioned, I think all of them have some songs that aren’t bad, they’re average, whatever. I know some people are defensive because I listed a lot of groups, specifically big groups with large fanbases, but they’re just examples. If I had no examples it would’ve been a problem, yet when I do give examples it’s a problem and I’m an anti. If you disagree, cool :) I like seeing people comments on why they disagree. If you purposely try to twist my words, say I’m someone who has never liked their music, I didn’t give them a chance, or even completely ignore my points to fit a narrative, then just block me and move on.

Edit 2: Edited this to be a bit more nice and to add songs I do enjoy.

This is the reason I don;t enjoy TXT, NCT, Ateez, or ENHYPEN's dance practices, heck even for GOT&'s Na na na I kinda had to grasp over some parts (and notice Enhypen and Got7 are my fav groups in this list). Imo, strong dancing does not mean better dancing.

Also I'm not being a hater, is just that this just makes me feel weird  
I feel this is unpopular because a lot of people might think this as just powerful dancing, is just that I think is cringe and makes my skin crawl, but curious if someone else thinks it

unpopularkpopopinions,wlumat,2022-08-11 17:45:55,"Most groups should have their own universe, storyline, lore, etc.","First of all ik for a fact this is extremely unpopular because when groups do this type of stuff it’s aimed towards a very specific group of people. Not many people watch an aespa or txt mv trying to figure out how everything ties into the their universe but personally I feel like when groups do this it adds a new level of fan interaction. I have so much appreciation towards the people who write out these storylines and how producers and songwriters would make music based off of the storytelling knowing very well sooooo many people will just skip over that aspect.

Groups like aespa, txt, ateez, billlie, Enhypen, bts, elast, kingdom, just b, etc they make me want to actually immerse myself in the worlds that they’re building with their songs and music videos and it just makes kpop a lot more fun in general. It makes me actually want to pay attention to what’s happening in the mv and not just focus on their visuals and choreography.

Now I say most groups and not all because a lot of groups don’t need to do the whole world building storytelling thing and still make me want to invest time into figuring out what’s actually happening in the mv if pulled off correctly, Jyp groups are a perfect example of that. But then yk we see a group coming from like yg where the budget on those music videos are insane but I don’t really focus too much on what’s going on over the choreo and how the song sounds. 

Like treasure for example, jikjin had Ferraris and lambos and all these different types of cars with this huge set full of huge led panels and while that’s cool I couldn’t really care for it all that much. Winner’s I love u had some incredible sets I just didn’t really care for, same with like every blackpink mv ever like they’re cool but if there’s nothing really going on other than dancing and looking cool and pretty there’s really no incentive to focus too much on the effort that went into the making of the mv as apposed to if there was a story or lore for me to look out for and to see how it ties into the lyrics.

Again I understand some people just want to see a cool looking mv and don’t wanna worry about how all of a sudden all of the members are vampires looking for treasure while their digital members are stuck in kwangya with an evil black mamba😭

unpopularkpopopinions,w64e6v,2022-07-23 15:45:23,Heeseung is the best rapper in Enhypen,"If you ask fan or non fan who's the best rapper in Enhypen they'll probably say Jay or Niki and it would make sense cause they are pushed right now as a main rappers. Heeseung as a unofficial main vocalist rarely got rap parts outside of future perfect, blessed cursed or boy in luv cover. He is also the only one who trained as a rapper before quitting to focus on vocals. And i think it's easy to hear that he got some experience in that.

The problem with Niki and Jay rapping for me is that they don't have any style at all, the don't try to emote with their voices or sound different in different songs. Heeseung on the other hand is trying to give a variety of tones and a lot of energy.

Niki got a longer rap in their new tt in second verse and it become my least favourite part in song followed by Jay/Niki/Sunghoon parts in first verse. It was the most tasteless and boring part in that song. Jay tone i like more but i have the same problems with his rapping as i stated before.

I find it interesting that i liked Heeseung rap in blessed cursed better than Niki cause i like his pronunciation, voice and style better even if it was short, the same is right now with future perfect where Hesseung has the shortest ""rap"" around 7 second but i liked it more than 1 jay rap and 2 nikis ones there.

And when it coming to live performances (encores) i think you can really hear the difference between them. Heeseung sounds relaxed, confident , you can see his effort and style he's trying to put into his verse. Jay and Niki sounds a lot weaker. And i know some people will say that encores are just for fun and you can't judge others by their performances there but honestly that's the only performances where they're singing it live.

I think it's unpopular beacuse even if people see Heeseung as one of the better rappers they wouldn't put him as the best in his group.

unpopularkpopopinions,vt23v2,2022-07-07 00:11:56,Girl groups do tough/dark concepts much better than boy groups,"To clarify what I mean by ""tough/dark"", I'm thinking about stuff like girl crush, songs that are rap heavy, etc. 

I feel like when girl groups do these concepts, it's generally a lot more convincing. When I watch them perform, I can genuinely believe that it could be similar to how they act off stage. For example, somebody like Olivia Hye has very natural expressions and way of rapping/singing. I don't think this is really the same for boy groups. A lot of the time, it seems like they're trying to pretend they're somebody they just aren't. I think a good example of this is Enhypen in their recent comeback or a group like Stray Kids. A lot of their members just end up looking very out of place because the way the present themself is wildly different than how they are off stage. It's always pretty obvious when a male idol's performance is based off of cultural appropriation rather than their own style. Obviously there are exceptions in both cases, but in general I think this is true.

I think this is unpopular (especially on reddit) because girl groups who do this type of concept are always called basic and boring (Loona, Class:y, etc.). On the other hand, boy groups who do this concept generally get a lot of love, and it's probably the most popular boy group concept at the moment because of that.

unpopularkpopopinions,vbpfty,2022-06-14 01:22:33,"kpop and western pop aren’t really that different, kpop stans are just mad at English lyrics","I can admit there are some differences between the two but kpop stans make it seem like western pop and kpop are on opposite sides of the spectrum. Now, this didn’t really bother me until people started acting like western pop is trash compared to kpop even though the two aren’t that different. 

I personally don’t see much difference in song structure. Most kpop songs follow the traditional verse>chorus>verse>chorus>bridge>final chorus/outro structure like in western songs. Don’t get me wrong, there are kpop songs that do change up the structure but even among kpop stans these are seen as experimental (sticker, O.O, next level). A lot of kpop songs have empty instrumental choruses/beat drops which aren’t as common in western pop but not unheard of. so in my opinion this is not a huge difference between the two. The biggest difference is that Korean lyrics are used in kpop and it literally just seems like kpop stans will hate any english release because it’s all in English and not because there is actually a major difference in production. Fever by Enhypen for example is one of their most famous songs if not their most famous and I could see so many western artists singing it. Anti-romantic by TXT is also one of TXT’s most famous b-sides and it was literally produced by a western artist and i could also see so many western artists singing it. Kpop stans have a problem with full english songs, as far as production and structure go there aren’t many major differences between kpop and western pop. 

I think this is unpopular because most of the English releases i’ve seen have received a lot of hate (bts butter and ptd, blackpink ice cream and KAMU, twice the feels). and people blame this on the songs sounding “too western” but i just think it’s because they are fully in english.

unpopularkpopopinions,v6axif,2022-06-06 21:03:32,"So far, the best song on each of Enhypen's albums has been the title track.","I think this is very unpopular because of how both Fever and Polaroid Love were way more popular than their respective title tracks, Drunk-Dazed and Blessed-Cursed - both b-sides have significantly more Spotify streams than their title tracks, Fever is Enhypen's most streamed song on Spotify by about 33 million, Polaroid Love was their first song to pass 10 million streams on MelOn, etc. Don't get me wrong, Fever and Polaroid Love are good songs, but to me, Drunk-Dazed and Blessed-Cursed are much better. 

Drunk-Dazed is such an addicting and unique (in Kpop, at least) song, I could literally listen to it on repeat for hours and not get tired of it, while Fever honestly gets a bit boring after a few listens. It's a great song and I genuinely love it a lot, but let's be honest, it's not exactly groundbreaking or even all that interesting. D-D, however, was totally unlike anything else I'd heard in Kpop before, and to my knowledge there hasn't been another song like it since. ~~I also feel a little icky listening to Fever because 3 of them were minors (international age) when it was released but that's a discussion for another time~~

Now for the *really* unpopular opinion: I really don't get the hype around Polaroid Love? I know a lot of its popularity came from it going viral on TikTok, and yeah it's a cute song and whatever, but kind of like Fever, I don't think it's anything special. I almost didn't even add it to my playlists, and I hardly ever listen to it now. In my opinion, it's easily one of Enhypen's most skippable songs. I LOVED Blessed-Cursed though, and I think it's their most underrated title track - it might honestly be my second favorite after D-D. 

All of Enhypen's b-sides are good, not just Fever and Polaroid Love - special shoutout to Flicker, 10 Months, and Upper Side Dreamin' - but their title tracks are just flawless to me. They're unique, dynamic, fun, and addictive - exactly what title tracks are supposed to be. The only one that *might* not be my favorite on its respective album is Given-Taken, but then again I probably listen to it more than any of its b-sides so I'm not sure.

unpopularkpopopinions,uvl9mm,2022-05-22 23:57:13,Companies should stop making groups through survival shows,"Why this could be unpopular: survival shows have many benefits for groups, mainly that it gives stans a chance to learn about them, support them and get attached before debut.

90% of the posts about Kep1er these days are talking about how toxic the solo stans are in their fandom. I have followed Enhypen since before debut and although it's subtler than Kep1er, it's easy to spot solo stans that are still holding things that happened on the show against the members even though it's literally been two years.

I just don't think dealing with endless hate and akgaes is worth the hype that survival shows get. Most if not all survival shows are rigged to some level, there will always be people who make it into the lineup who maybe weren't the best choice, and there will always be contestants that deserved better who get eliminated. There will always be evil editing, unfair line distributions, differing amounts of screentime, etc. but the fact that people remember all of that and then still bring it up long after the group debuts is so irritating.

These shows just bring out the absolute worst in stans and it's the contestants that have to suffer for it for the rest of their careers.

I don't know, maybe it only seems that way because these groups just debuted. Twice and Monsta X are also groups from survival shows but I have never seen any antis bring up other contestants from their shows so maybe, hopefully with time it'll die down. For now though it just seems super toxic.

Obviously, not all of them are bad without a MV/stage performance, in fact, some are crucial to the song as it replaces certain aspects of a song structure (ie. bridge, outro). For example, Love Dive by IVE, Fever by Enhypen, Fearless by Le Sserafim.

However, there are some songs where the song literally could’ve sounded the same without the dance break (More & More by Twice and ONE by Astro comes into mind). Sure, it’s really nice to watch the main dancer slay, but it’s not something we can do when we’re just listening to the song on Spotify/Apple Music and you’re kind of just stuck there with an annoying instruments ringing in your ear.

Bts has shown that it’s possible to just cut out the dance break and leave it solely for performances and music videos with ON and I think it’s about time other groups start doing the same with unneeded dance breaks.

I think it’s an unpopular opinion just because people don’t seem to mind or care about it? I mean sure it’s nice and amazing to watch your idols dance but I genuinely see some dance break instrumentals as a really annoying loading screen leading up to certain parts of a song but I’m quite sure not a lot of people see it that way

Its honestly quite obvious that for now at least, 4th gen girl groups are doing much better than 4th gen boy groups musically. For ggs, their music is far more versatile nowadays, and most of them (even some nugu ones) have a unique type of element in their group that makes them stand out in a crowd, eg. Stayc, LOONA, billlie, aespa and many more. However on the other hand, I feel like the quality of boy group music has really started going downhill since 4th gen. I’m not saying that ALL of them are bad, I personally really like TXT, ENHYPEN and Oneus’ music. But it definitely feels like smaller companies saw NCT succeeding with their experimental music in 2017 and ran with it. Not saying that 4th gen bgs aren’t talented, in fact I know a lot of talent vocalists/dancers that don’t get to showcase their abilities because of their concept restrictions. I was watching Show Champion a few weeks ago for my ult, and at least 3 bgs had the same concept and music that it was hard to differentiate them from each other.  I wish companies would stop forcing the “tough and fierce manly concept”, when male idols have much more talent and much more to showcase to the public.  A great example is how in 2nd gen, we had 2pm, VIXX, B.A.P and Infinite that distinguished themselves from others, and for 3rd gen we had seventeen, BTS and much more. Its just a bit disappointing seeing how all companies stick to one concept  without having much versatility in the market, when in reality 4th gen male idols are more talented than you think. I think this is an unpopular opinion because I’ve seen many many people comment on the newer generations idols talent and abilities so I just want to state my opinion on this fiasco.

unpopularkpopopinions,uckdh6,2022-04-26 21:18:42,infantilisation of idols is just as bad as sexualisation,"a little long sorry!

I've noticed it's always 'sexualisation' of idols being talked about but almost never the idea of them being 'infantilised' by fans which is very very common and just as bad. One thing I've noticed that it is always the maknaes that tend to suffer from extreme infantilization by fans even after they turn the legal age.

Jungkook (bts) is a huge victim of this till this day. Jungkook debuted when he was 15 years old, so I think it was really natural for so many fans, even the people around him to find him super cute and even feel naturally 'protective' over him. However, jungkook is not 15 years old anymore, he's not even close to it. He's more closer to 30 than he'll ever be to 20 years old. Some fans baby jungkook so much to the point where it just seems so weird and unnatural. They treat him like he's still 15 rather than a 24 year old (26 in korea) man. I also just know they are the same fans that act like Jin is 60 years old. Even comments made towards him are just so weird, they're like 'I'm only 16 years old but I feel like jungkook is my son'. Miss ma'am, you need therapy. I remember during one of the fansigns where a fan gave jungkook a bonnet, and please correct me if I'm wrong but it seemed like he didn't that like at all. Obviously he didn't, he was like 21 years old or something. Jungkook probably had the biggest glow up/change compared to his members, we all know he now has a full-sleeved tattoo, eyebrow piercing and a lip piercing for almost a year now. There are still so many armys till today whining and upset that he seemed to have lost his 'baby image'. I genuinely feel so embarrassed to type this but the amount of people who were 'hurt' that jungkook got tatted up? way too many. Even the comments are like 'no why did he do that, he's just a baby'.

This isn't just jungkook of course, I've seen it happen with huening kai, especially during lovesong era, and now ni-ki from enhypen seems to be the main victim (along with extreme sexualisation, please give this boy a break). I made a post a while ago about how ni-ki is treated like he's an adult and a baby at the same time and how it was very harmful to him. Luckily, there were many who understood and agreed with me but there were still some comments, even dms sent to me asking how infantilization was bad, meaning it should be fine because ni-ki is 16 years old. I don't want anyone to misunderstand what I'm trying to say here, I'm not saying no one is allowed to find them cute of course not, hell I find jungkook super cute and he's a grown man compared to me, but there are certain boundaries that fans shouldn't cross because it can make the idol uncomfortable. Ni-ki (enhypen) has expressed several times that he doesn't like it when fans treat him like a baby or call him a baby. Obviously this doesn't mean fans should go ahead and treat him like an adult because he's still a minor and young. Some engenes have ni-ki trapped in this 'baby box' and an 'adult box' at the same time, no one is allowed to find him cute or attractive at all according to them. Being the youngest member of the group must really be so hard.

This is probably an unpopular opinion because I've seriously seen so many fans express how 'infantilization' isn't as bad as sexualisation because 'at least they're not sexualising them', please correct me if I'm wrong but isn't infantilisation a form of sexualisation? This is also incredibly creepy and even harmful especially after the maknae turns of legal age.

Disclaimer: i am open for discussion and other POVS if they are written respectfully. So as stated i don't agree with what many engenes think of Heesung being an ace. He is definitly really talented and hardworking but i feel like he isn't an ace yet at least. I think everyone knows or have heard abt the term ""ace"" in kpop which stands for an idol who is really complete (gifted basically) in singing, dancing, rapping sometimes song writting and producing and can include other things such as sports or other activities. Even tough i know and acknowlodge Heesung as a really talented idol i don't think he has everything that an ace requires. 

His strenghts or most powerful abilities imo:

Singing- this is strenght imo. He has a really strong and beautiful voice. it's a bless to hear him singing and having fun. He is also really stable and one of the best in his group. Dancing- he is a good dancer imo. Not his biggest strenght but he definitly has what it's needed imo. He is really charismatic as well (perhaps that's why they chose him to perform on MAMA intro stage). 

He plays an instrument guitar from what i've seen which is definitly good and is a strenght byt itself.

Now i'll be going to the things that make me feel a bit off in him being called an ace:

rapping- in ENHYPEN he doesn't have much opportunity to rap. However in ENHYPEN covers such as BTS covers (specialy these ones) he has shown his rapping skills. I would say he raps in an average level (meaning is not the best but not bad if you know what i mean) but something lacks. He doesn't have his own flow, identity or expression rapping. He raps just because the songs requires it. I do know that many idols are idol rappers and not rapper which make them have this sort of lack of personality rapping. However when i look at aces even if they are idol rappers such as JK or Jennie i can still feel their identity on those rap verses. I can feel that no one can easily replace their tone or swag whatever you call it. I don't feel the same with Heesung. 

Songwritting- i know he started to write lyrics back in the days of his predebut but he never actually wrote lyrics for ENHYPEN or even to other groups (as i know correct me if i am wrong). Therefore i can't say if he has or not good songwritting skills. I assume he has because he is really talented however we still can't clearly tell that. Imo that's to blame on belift/hybe bcs they probably don't let the boys have much freedom yet. I am not going into producing because it's something a bit more complicated to talk abt since many aces don't produce their own songs. It would be unfair then to judge by that.

This to stay he has both strenghts and weaknesses and that i acknolowdge them as this. Because of it i don't think he is untalanted or anything i just don't think that he has the profile yet. Aces are nearly 10/10 in the majority of this categories: take JK or Jennie as examples. So i don't think Heesung is an ACE yet but he is definitly talented and has the potencial to become one.

To curious people if i had to select a female and a male ace for 4th gen i would argueable say: Han from Stray Kids and Soyeon from (G)-IDLE

I never really thought about which of the groups I stanned did or didn't have a strong Korean fanbase until the whole situation with Soyeon and Ateez, and I saw nevies trashing Ateez for being unknown in Korea.

And it reminded of the time I saw a post from a Korean girl who said that they don't see Jennie's advertisements around Korea, it's mostly Irene and Yuna. (I don't know if it's true, just what I saw) It wasn't said in a mean way so I didn't think much of it but all of her comments were filled with people calling her a liar, an anti and implying that she didn't live in Korea? Not saying this is representative of the entire fandom but damn those three blinks really put in the work to drag her!!

And even if it's not one specific situation, I see stans bring up Korean charting all the time knowing damn they don't check them regularly or even understand what's going on half the time. People were relishing in the fact that Kep1er and Treasure apparently didn't rank that high on Korean charts with their debuts. (I don't know if that's true, just what I saw)

The more I thought about the groups whose music really hit for me, the more I realized that they were the groups that had much, much bigger international fanbases than Korean ones, like Blackpink, Stray Kids, Ateez, Enhypen, etc. (EDIT: I am **NOT** saying Blackpink is unknown in Korea. I thought I made that clear but apparently not. They are being grouped in with these other groups because I'm talking about having a **huge, possibly majority, int fanbase.**) These are all groups that still have merch sales, streams, award nominations, and social media followers.

I just don't understand why it's a bad thing. If it's true it's true. A lot of BGs, especially 4th gen BGs, aren't big in Korea. That's tough, but what can you do? I'm not trying to generalize all Koreans as having one taste but there's clearly a majority preference, and some groups just don't fit that vibe. Some groups have music that is blatantly more suitable for the West because it uses western musical elements and western writers.

I get it, the approval of the home base is always the most important. If you were an idol who only ever lived in Korea, you would want the approval of the people you care about, and knowing that you're popular in some unknown country across the sea is cool but not the same.

But what difference does it make for **stans** besides bragging rights?

I just don't see the reason to take offense to the statement, and the less we take offense to it, the less it'll be used as an insult. If anything, it's kind of a plus because groups that know they're big internationally put more of an effort to provide subtitles and songs in other languages.

unpopularkpopopinions,thjfx4,2022-03-19 01:36:04,"not every group needs a ""rags to riches"" or a ""sob"" story (4th gen edition)","**hey guys I made this post on kpopthoughts and it got deleted because it was mentioned that it suits this subreddit more, so I hope you guys don't mind that I'm reposting!!**

a little long im so sorry!!

i think it's incredibly amazing and inpsiring how some groups such as gfriend, mamamoo and of course, the legendary bts, were able to bring their broke companies to the absolute top. bts going from literal nobodies to the top kpop group in the whole world is seriously so phenomenal and amazing. but something i always wondered about, is why so many kpop fans are so obsessed with the whole ""underdog"" story.

I think now that the 3rd generation of kpop is slowly fading, many companies have debuted new groups to ""replace"" their previous artists. And so many of these companies happen to be one of the top entertainment companies, so the juniors debuting have some amazing and successful seniors, such as (twice-itzy, bts-txt/enha, red velvet-aespa, got7-skz)

I'm not going to act like being under the big3/4 companies doesn't have it's own benefits, because it definitely does, but why are some people so against any group debuting under one of those companies? Literally to be able to debut under a big company must be such a surreal and and incredible feeling. I've seen a lot of korean trainees training experiences, and majority of them mentioned that ""just"" passing the first round is considered to be a huge achievement. We all heard and seen idols talking about their own trainee experience, and almost all of them have mentioned how it was the lowest point of their lives and how so many of them considered quitting. It's even worse after debuting because they have to be constantly practicing and recording, and having packed schedules. Why can't they experience idol life in comfort and security? I know it's unfair and upsetting that groups from smaller companies don't get such benefits, but why are we discrediting and shaming the ones that do?

It really feels like some fans don't want big3/4 companies to debut anymore groups. Are young people not allowed to dream and fantasize about being in the same company as their idols? Do they all have to start from absolute ""zero"" so they can come of as deserving and credited of their fame? If they get an offer to debut, should they just turn it down? Like, fans of these big groups can't even praise or celebrate their achievements without people mentioning how ""privileged"" they are. There's a very very high chance that these idols know that being under a huge company with amazing seniors gives them a lot of publicity. Itzy's Yuna spoke about it, TXT members are still acknowledging it 3 YEARS LATER! Obviously, being under a huge company has so many benefits, but some people really really fail to realise and understand the hardships that come with it. Firstly, debuting under a big company is extremely difficult despite what many people might say. I heard they have like hundred thousands of applications every year. For exo members to debut, 120 trainees were competing for just 12 spots. Ningning was the only SMROOKIE to actually make it into aespa, it was that competitive. If we look at majority of the idols today, so many of them are ex-SM, ex-JYP, ex-YG and even now, ex-Bighit trainees. Almost every single idol wannabe try out for their career by auditioning to the top companies, and when they fail to be in the final lineup, they go somewhere else and try their luck somewhere else. Secondly, people have extremely high expectations of your debut. When your senior is someone like bts or red velvet, people are going to expect you to be similar to them or even better. I was watching TXT's debut behind the show and there was a clip where beomgyu tripped and fell while performing and was extremely upset and even cried on stage. This year he spoke about it and he said he felt so guilty because the atmosphere was ""unapologetic"" and his mistake is counted as the whole group's mistake. Fans will be more harsher and more critical when you're an big3/4 idol and your mistakes most likely won't be sidelined.

Thirdly, every single achievement or celebration of yours will most likely be discredited or shamed by fans. TXT is almost a 3 YEAR OLD GROUP, have composed and produced so many songs since debut yet every single time they win anything it's ""thanks to bts"" or ""thank you hybe privilege"". What do you want them to do? "" Thank you to our fans and our company's privilege, we managed to win today""? Big3/4 groups have a lot of benefits and oppurtunities yes, but it's not a bad thing or crime like how some fans are making it out to be. The industry is already so harsh and intense and so much goes on behind the scenes, them having a stable and secure career should be viewed positively rather than negatively. If you gave your underrated faves the same energy you're giving to these groups by hating on them for no reason, maybe your faves will be able to get a win or something.

I really don't want to be rude or offend anyone, but I can't help but feel like there is some sort of jealousy/envy or inferiority complex especially when it comes to the 4th generation of idols. The amount of ""I wish I looked like yuna"" or ""I wish I looked like wonyoung"", ""I wish I was Karina"" posts are a little concerning. I think it's fine to be a little jealous or wish you had the same lifestyle as them but from the comments I've seen about them, it seems like it's severe jealousy. Idols like karina, wonyoung, bahiyyih and yuna are dragged on the daily and what have they done to deserve this? absolutely nothing at all. This reminds of how last year a redditor made a post about jennie and it was just pure hate and a year later she came and apologized and said she just felt ""insignificant"" compared to jennie because they were both the exact same age but living completely different lives. Like I said, it's fine to be a bit sad or jealous but going around and spreading hate comments? what do you gain out of doing it? Aespa has been dragged on reddit since the day they debuted to the point where the moderators had to ban any post criticising them. I want to say that when aespa debuted they had stage presence and they were doing so well. I'm 100% positive that all the hate and criticism they're recieving is what made them unconfident on stage. Look at how ningning regressed, compare her black mamba stage to the dreams come true, she seems so anxious and scared I really feel bad for her. There's no way idols don't see the bad comments about them.

I stan a lot of small groups as well and honestly it is sad seeing them not do well, but what's annoying and frustrating is when fans of these small groups hate on much bigger groups. I get being upset and wanting better for your faves but what will actively hating and discrediting them do? I saw a post recently and it said smaller group fans should be allowed to be 'salty' and express dissatisfaction, but I completely disagree sorry, because what if the roles were reversed?. Like I said, its very understandable to be upset, but spreading hate and then trying to justify it by 'wanting more for your fave' is just wrong and even disrespectful to bigger groups. This might sound a little weird, but I always notice when fans are asked ""if you were an idol, which company do you want to be under?"" and majority of the responses are always from the big3+ Hybe, not even mid-tier companies like Cube, FNC or RBW. Fans want o be under big companies themselves yet shame the actual idols working for these companies. Let's make it make sense.

I think this might be an unpopular opinion because fans love a 'sob story' so much and like the idea that their fave started from absolute zero to be where they are today. Also big groups from 4th gen such as txt, aespa, enhypen, straykids and itzy are usually perceived and viewed as 'privileged'.

What are your opinions?

This means I will decide whether or not to buy an album based on the concepts, set, and styling of the group.

For example, I pre-ordered the [Scylla version](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAAkO86VgAQrWgc?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) of Enhypen's Dimension: Dilemma album bc I loved the styling there. I looked forward to getting their photos and posters. But their Dimension: Answer album had more [lackluster concepts](https://external-preview.redd.it/nWuq7R_KKZ3KsuZfFgB-VkK8UckEzR7vInvC-nmmqZY.jpg?auto=webp&s=7c787db13cc4daea5dc8d2468dfda444a21ef4af) so I elected not to buy the album. Both decisions had entirely to do with concepts. Music just did not factor into it.

Now if I really like a song or music video I will make an effort to stream it and buy the digital version. It's my way of telling the company -- ""Yes, I really like this one, please make more stuff like this one here.""

I thought I'd make this post bc I've seen fans get bashed for pre-ordering albums before they hear the music.

I think this is a fairly unpopular opinion because fans tend to buy more full albums than they do mini or single albums. There is a generally positive correlation between the quantity of music on an album and sales of said album. But to me this makes no sense because most fans don't consume music through CDs.

unpopularkpopopinions,t6b9ah,2022-03-04 06:08:34,Group Subreddits Being Filled With Photos is a Huge Turn-off,"Currently, I am in the BTS, TXT, Enhypen, Blackpink and Seventeen subs and all of them as well as some other group's subs I just checked have many posts with photos that the idols or company uploaded on  SNS or their photoshoots. The only sub that I have seen that doesn't have this yet is BTS.

I joined reddit to engage in discussions regarding kpop, by joining the groups reddit I found that I can keep up with the group's activity and new releases. However, I am not interested in their photoshoots or selfies. I like the songs, the variety shows, the fan content, even vlives, but I have never been interested in checking out their photos.

Thus, whenever I open reddit, which I use on my laptop, seeing my home page (or whatever it's called) filled with photoshoots, and them taking up the entire screen is not something I like. The r/kpop sub doing this makes sense. Since it has people from different fandoms, there are people who are bound to check out a performance, song, album, etc if they find it appealing even if they don't follow the group. I did this with Fromis9's It's Live performance. However, the groups sub is mostly followed by fans of the group, and people who like a group but are not fans (probably antis as well, but let's just ignore them.) So, there is no need for full photos to be there.

Also, most social media sites allow you to see the posts without signing in. Thus, there shouldn't be a problem of you not being able to open it. As far as I know Weverse, and IG thoughts are the only exceptions, atleast among the apps idols use. Thus, you can just put a link for them and everything would be so much better.

[This is how posts can be made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/t5k6nr/220303_rm_on_instagram/) [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/t6af4m/220304_ros%C3%A9_for_oioi/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/enhypen/comments/t5aq33/220303_twitter_sunoo/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TomorrowByTogether/comments/t682oo/220304_yeonjun_twitter/) is how I wish they were not done.

I don't have as much of a problem  videos because that gives me an idea about whether I want to check them out or not, even then maybe having them just a link could be better, but I know that I don't want to check out the photos and even if I did want to check them, it won't take too long for me just open the link.

REASON FOR BEING UNPOPULAR: Most group subs seem to be following the same format, and hence I am assuming that most people don't have a problem with this.  Also, a lot of fans are into storing photos of idols, so I think they might prefer it this way.

Edit: If so many people agree, do you think it is possible to change this?

unpopularkpopopinions,sr6heh,2022-02-13 02:19:47,I haven’t liked any Enhypen’s songs until “Paraloid Love”,"First of all, I was a big follower and watched all episodes of I-Land. I also love the final line-up of Enhypen as well. So, I had no complain and was super hyped for their debut. However, the debut song came out and I was like “that sounds not bad. Not my cup of tea, but it’s unique”. 

Then “Drunk-dazed” came out and it’s such a loud, over processed song that it really turned me off. I know many fans love this song, but I just can’t stand the overly noisy chorus. Then, “Tamed-dashed” and “Blessed-cursed” came out and I lost all the interest because the two songs have no hook or unique sounds; they sound honestly like any kpop boy group songs, generic. 

Until, they start promote “Paraloid Love” that I actually like them, and it’s just a b-side song. The song is less processed and actually showcase their voices more naturally. It’s cute and organic. The “It’s Live” really makes me like them again. I hope the producer team will give them more of this. But I doubt it is the case. 

I know this is an unpopular opinion because many people really like their title tracks, but none of those songs do anything for me 😕

unpopularkpopopinions,stpqi9,2022-02-16 08:11:57,4th gen BGs aren't less successful than 4th gen GGs. They aren't unpopular either.,"At least on reddit, way too many people think that 4th gen BGs are less successful than 4th gen GGs. So I believe that this is an unpopular opinion.

Let me preface this by listing the top 4th gen BGs. We've got Stray Kids, TXT, Enhypen, Ateez and The Boyz. Enough said but some people are interesting.

""Their success is only fandom-driven""


So what if 4th gen boygroups' success is fandom-driven? Where do you think these fans came from? If these BGs were able to secure an enormous and devoted fanbase which constantly grows and, will pay their bills and break their own records till they retire from the music industry, how is that unsuccessful? Isn't that an achievement on it's own? How is that a bad or shameful thing? Even popular GGs' fandoms are way weaker than that of BGs but I don't see anyone claiming that they're unsuccessful because of it.

GGs rely on GP support and while that may provide them more cultural relevance and popularity, their longevity is at risk. There are higher chances of GGs being forgotten since they lack the strong fandoms BGs do. At the same time, BGs won't achieve cultural relevance or leave an influential impact outside their fandom if they fail to capture the GP's attention. \*\*So yes, both GP-driven success and fandom-driven success have their own pros and cons. Both GGs and BGs are successful but in different aspects.\*\*

So what if their digitals on korean charts are poor? BGs are way more popular internationally and gain more traction on intl platforms. Yes, that's alright. They're physical monsters and bring in loads of money to their respective companies. While the top GGs too have good sales, the BGs still sell better than them by a huge margin. I don't get how selling 300k-500k and above during every CB is unsuccessful. 

Last but not the least, let us not act like 4th gen BGs haven't got any hit songs. Fever, Polaroid Love, Anti Romantic, Cat & Dog, God's Menu, Back Door, Deja Vu, Thriller etc. are all pretty damn popular and did go viral. Must be nice to flop like that huh?

unpopularkpopopinions,snwc1p,2022-02-08 23:08:33,"Twice will not renew their contracts, but it will mainly be by JYPE's choosing, not theirs.","*Hear me out.*

A contract renewal occurs when a contract expires and **BOTH** parties involved agree to renew it.

Something I never see talked about is that JYPE themselves could 100% choose to not go forward with Twice for another 7 years *(EDIT: I was not aware that contract renewals could be less than 7 years, I apologize)* , and I have a few reasons to support that as a genuine possibility.

**1) Age.** I know this is very obvious, but all of the Twice members are in their early to late 20s, with the oldest, Nayeon, being 26 & the youngest, Tzuyu, being 22. While there are active female kpop idols in their 30s (Irene, Taeyeon, Jessi, Solar, etc.), JYPE has only ever had 1 female idol under the company that reached 30 (Fei from Miss A, & she turned 30 only 8 months before their official disbandment). I find it unlikely that JYPE would make an exception for pretty much all of Twice.

**2) New Groups.** I think it's incredibly obvious that JYPE is trying to create a new era of succesful & more modern groups. With NiziU, Xdinary Heroes, & now NMIXX, not to mention the 2 other rookie groups expected to debut in 2023, it seems as if JYPE is trying to compete with the ever-changing kpop market. Though there are still people who appreciate Twice's more traditional 3rd gen concept, we're beginning to see more success among the Enhypen, Aespa, Stray Kids-type groups compared to the success Twice has garnered over the past few years, which leads me to my 3rd and final point.

**3) Commercial Success.** Looking at the numbers alone, Twice is doing pretty well compared to previous releases. They are streamed a ton on spotify & people are still excited to see them on tour & see the next projects they are working on. However, we can only assume that JYPE will not be as satisfied with the 400-500k album sales that have been consistent since their debut now that they've seen a group like Stray Kids get 1 million and 700k consecutively on their last 2 releases, within only 4 years of their debut. & without even looking at numbers, the past few Twice releases (Scientist, Alcohol-Free, The Feels), I have seen be criticized FAR more than any other Twice release. Whether or not the company sees that and takes that into account, we will never know, but it is something to keep in the back of your mind.

I constantly see the claims that Twice won't renew their contract because of personal reasons, or that Twice will renew their contract because JYPE can't risk losing them as an artist, which is why I feel as if my opinion isn't as considered. From what individual Twice members have said, they are incredibly happy to be on tour & cannot wait to see more of their fans, which is why I believe that the contract not being renewed could maybe not be up to them. I also feel like a lot of the conversation around this topic falls back on speculation of mistreatment by the company which hasn't ever really been 100% proven. At the end of the day, JYPE is a major entertainment company, & they will decide, very bluntly, whether or not Twice has a future at the company or not. *I promise you, JYPE as a corporation does not care that Twice is ""iconic.""*

&#x200B;

*EDIT: I want to make it abundantly clear before you start to berate me in the comments that I do not in any way think that it would be rational or morally correct for JYPE to let the girls go.* ***My argument is not that they SHOULD it's that they COULD***\*, and people rule it out as being a possibility when in reality it is. That is my opinion, please do not misunderstand and claim that I'm advocating for Twice to disband. Thank you <3\*

unpopularkpopopinions,sf7t0u,2022-01-29 03:38:17,HYBE has poor music production and shouldn’t be as praised as it is.,"Disclaimer: Not a professional musician (I’ve been playing for 10 years) but I’ve worked with various music softwares for a while now (6+ years). This is just my opinion overall. 

 Hybe used to have great production. BTS used to be its only group, and from 2013-2019 or so, I think their production was fantastic. It was clean and professional, overall very pleasant to listen to. Then…Around 2020 is when it started to lack a bit. 
I’m not talking about autotune mind you. I’m talking about 

1. The way vocals are layered onto instrumental tracks 
2. Volume 
3. Vocals IN GENERAL 

By number 1, I mean that no matter WHAT the instrumentation sounds like, the vocals sound essentially the same. Whether I’m listening to a ballad, punk, rnb, EDM, etc. track or not is irrelevant…the vocals placed on TOP are for hip-hop. Because HYBE uniformly produces hip-hop suitable vocals for non-hip hop songs, the listening experience is so JARRING. It sounds really strange, and takes away from the potential of their songs melody-wise. You’ll have entirely vocal-centered songs sounding like they aren’t *supposed* to be centering vocals at all. 20 cm, Blue Hour, Dynamite, Ghosting, etc. I feel like all of this songs could be 2000x better if the vocals didn’t clash with the music. 

For example, 20 cm is a classically rnb track. You’d expect to hear the subtle rise and fall of TXT’s voices, great emotion, and vocals on the raw side: bare and vulnerable. Instead you get…the opposite of that. It’s sad. 

2. Simply put, HYBE’s instrumentals are too fricken loud. This makes each song sound crowded and overwhelming to listen to. This is a problem across the music industry now, but Jesus…the vocals at HYBE are fighting for their LIVES. HYBE composes a lot of great melodies, but the overwhelming volume of each instrumental track takes away from the pleasure of listening. 

3. This builds on my first-point, but HYBE has the worst “finished-product” sounding vocals of the big 4. Despite so much subtlety being crucial for beautiful or pleasant group vocals: vibrato, crescendos, tone, resonance, etc. — HYBE seems hell-bent on completely removing those subtleties. The vocals sound as flat and sterile as possible. 

I think it’s unpopular because a lot of people praise HYBE’s work with ENHYPEN and TXT in particular. Feel free to disagree lol.

Edit: By loud instrumentals, I’m not saying it’s “noise music” as people on Reddit like to call it and argue about. I literally mean the volume of each instrument in relation to the other on HYBE tracks is too high, and ends up making the instrumentals sound muddy and unpleasant. Like if the drums are as loud as the vocals are, you can’t clearly hear either.

There are a lot worse names, like AB6IX for example, still don't know how to pronounce that.

Or some groups whose name was initially hated by many, but later became accepted as good names (Itzy, Aespa, Enhypen)

And group names that are their main obstacle in getting out of nugudom (no offense), you can't easily find their songs in Google or YT because of their name : Nature, Kingdom, Billie.

Meanwhile , Nmixx is 

1 - easy to pronunce (En-Mix), 

2 - represents their concept well(n represents new, next, unknown, MIXX represents mixture/diversity in concept or as they described - best combination to represent next era)

3 - easy to distinguish hence easy to find in Google or YT.

Unpopular opinion because many think this name is not creative enough and more like some random words thrown together.

While I loved it while it lasted, I’m actually kind of glad it seems to be over for the most part in kpop. And I’m actually looking forward to see what music style will define kpop in 2022.

Recently I’ve noticed there’s been a bit of a surge in the pop-punk (I hope that’s what it’s called) sound and concept as well. With amazing songs like ITZY’s Loco, TXT’s 0x1=Lovesong, and Enhypen’s Blessed-Cursed, I found an unexpected love for songs that are still very much kpop but have slight hints of that 2010s pop-punk sound. For this reason, I wouldn’t mind if that became the next big trend in kpop like how the retro concept did in 2020.

I think this is unpopular mainly because I haven’t seen that much talk about it in major kpop spaces yet. Plus, I imagine that punk music isn’t something a lot of us kpop fans have a strong connection with (not that it’s not possible). It seems if it will become a trend, it’s just starting out and I’m personally open to more groups and artists trying that genre out. I definitely think I’d enjoy it over the disco/retro style of 2020 tbh. And I really hope I got the right genre by calling it pop-punk, I’m not that educated in music production so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.

Edit: For clarification, I mentioned Loco more so for the 2010s teen-punk __styling__, Enhypen and TXT’s songs are more so the genre I meant. Thanks to everyone for sassing me about it in the replies lmao, but I appreciate it because I genuinely don’t know that much about the genre.

Edit2: I really wasn’t intending to call pop-punk an old genre! By “retro trend” in the title I meant the literal retro trend that went on in kpop during 2020, sorry if that bothered anyone!

unpopularkpopopinions,rwq8lw,2022-01-05 17:04:53,(Most of) The Enhypen Members Can't Sing Because They Weren't Ready to Debut,"(hop in for a looooong rant)

~~(i hope i don't get cancelled for this)~~

I believe this is unpopular because I don't see this argument being brought up often whenever people criticize Enhypen.

*(disclaimer: I'm very casual when it comes to Enhypen and I don't know a whole lot about them, so I might be wrong. If any Engenes want to correct me in the comments, I encourage you to do so.)*

Now, to be clear. I don't think all Enhypen members are absolutely terrible or unprepared. I would say Jungwon and specially Heeseung are pretty good vocalists (Heeseung's voice is actually quite nice to the ears, probably the most promising out of all of them) , and Sunghoon has an okay falsetto.

However... this leaves you with a group of 7 members where only 3 of them can actually sort of sing. That wouldn't be a problem if the rest were rappers, but thing is, they're not. They get singing lines most of the time. This leaves the overall impression that **Enhypen is a group of subvocalists that can bust a choreography.**

Whenever I listen to their songs or watch their live (""live"") stage performances, I get dumbfounded at the amount of autotune, pitch correction and editing that goes through every syllable they sing. Watching the *Legend of Kpop* collab stage they did with TXT, it was so excessive that for one of the members (I think it was Sunghoon) to sing a simple ""ooh"", he had to sound like a male Hatsune Miku. Like, what? Is it that bad? Are we really talking about idols (people that, in theory, should at least be able to sing a little bit, even if it's not their role in the group) that **can't hold a note without needing editing**? I don't know if other people think this is okay, but I think that's very serious.

 In addition, I saw a live performance on a radio show they did for their song ""**Not For Sale**"" and... it was a bit sad to watch, honestly. Heeseung was the only one who looked comfortable, and the rest looked like they were forced into a karaoke session of a random song, instead of being artists singing their own song. I think they lacked confidence because they knew they weren't prepared to sing live without a backtrack.

But of course that's not their fault. Mostly, I blame this on HYBE, for doing I-Land and shoving all these boys (some of which had been trainees for less than a year) into a survival program and allowing them to debut being this unexperienced. All because HYBE has become far too megalomaniac in their search to monopolize just about everything in the K-Pop industry, releasing boygroup after boygroup, looking for even fresher concepts and younger members for more longevity in the industry, even if they've only trained for eight months.

Here's what would've solved this: let's get some fvcking vocal coaches on the board??? How about that???? How is it that Big Hit, with their infinite Motherlode budget, can't afford to properly train their idols on how to at least be an average singer? Or was it just that they didn't have enough time to honne their skills? I honestly can't tell, because I actually do see potential in them with some more training and experience.

 I guess the moral of the story is: **kpop companies in general should start debuting trainees, even if slightly older than the average nowadays** (aka adults), **that have actually had enough training time to be all around a good and complete artist.**

unpopularkpopopinions,ru0qda,2022-01-02 04:46:21,BTS deserve a military enlistment exemption because they do more good for Korea as idols,"This opinion is unpopular because many kpop fans don't think it's fair for BTS to skip service. It's also sometimes seen as disrespectful towards the military and government of Korea to say someone shouldn't have to serve. In this thread, I will argue that in fact BTS have already and will continue to serve Korea as a nation more as idols than they ever could in the military.

Okay, so the notion behind enlistment in the first place is largely that every man in Korea should contribute something, give back to the country by serving in the military.

The trouble with BTS' situation is, yes they could serve the country in this way... But would it REALLY be of more benefit than them continuing to be basically Korea's international cultural ambassadors?

That's just speaking culturally. Economically? BTS actually brings in SO much money to Korea. They probably make up 80% of HYBE sales, which means if they all enlist together for 18 months, many many people are going to lose their jobs. 

It's just reality that a huge corporation like HYBE isn't going to be able to employ its full compliment of staff without its biggest group. 

TXT can enlist. Enhypen can enlist eventually. And I'm a MOA and Engene.

But BTS simply cannot enlist. It's going to have too big an impact, negatively, not just on HYBE as a company but on Korea as a nation.

Let's also remember that this standard is already applied to, say, athletes the country feels have contributed more through their sport than they would have in the military. 

So BTS not only deserves a military service exemption as in ""they earned it!""... It actually would be noticeably detrimental to SK as a country to have some of their biggest cultural ambassadors out of commission for a year and a half for the sake of some low level military duties that ultimately will never match their contributions as idols.

I'm also not saying NO other groups deserve this exemption. Like maybe my other favs TXT and Enhypen will be as big as BTS in a few years. Who knows. And maybe there are some current other BGs who deserve it. I'd have to consider each case. 

My point is more that this pathway should be open to idols since it's available to sports stars. Basically, if anyone's contributions in their job as a Korean ambassador greatly outweigh whatever contributions they'd be able to make in the military, then you should remain in that job whether it's sports or singing.

And BTS definitely does more good for Korea out there being cultural ambassadors for the whole nation than they would in the military, no matter how noble that is.

unpopularkpopopinions,rqrm8s,2021-12-28 23:32:17,SM *solidly* is the worst big3/big4 company music-wise this year (YG excluded because it's almost missing in action),"Why I think this is unpopular? Well... Because *""SM does amazing music""* is like one of the kpop axioms. And I would have agreed in some years or even periods... But... Writing down a 2021 company recap in another comment I realized how much their ratio hit/miss is low compared to the other companies. 

I am **not** considering ""what is the absolutely best release?"" or ""how many good releases there were?"". I am looking at the list of the companies artists (most of them, I obviously don't listen to every single song) and doing my personal ratio hit/miss. It's obvious that a lot of artists = a lot of good songs, but if there are a lot of bad songs from a lot of other artists my personal ratio will be low(er). 

- 1) JYPE had amazing music from Twice, SKZ and Day6, basically everything they have released + half of Itzy full album and most of their mini. So almost everything. I hated the title track Mafia in the Morning and a couple of b-sides of Crazy in Love (just not to seem too enthusiastic). It's just that Twice, SKZ and Day6 released a lot of music and all of that so good, it's like *95%* of bops, it's absurd. 

- 2) HYBE had a good portion of good TXT releases (listened on shuffle, I may have missed something, I liked what I listened to) and Drunk Dazed of Enhypen (didn't listen to the albums I'll admit). I hated BTS English releases. Seventeen and Fromis_9 overall were golden acquisitions. *80% good* (may be higher or slightly lower if I listened to Enhypen albums, anyway very good). 

- 3) SM was a fiasco with basically all of Red Velvet group and solo albums (musically, I am sorry), Taeyeon (musically, I am sorry pt2 but I hated Weekend) and 2/3 of Aespa mini. (Next Level and Yeppi Yeppi were good.) I loved Taemin title track but the mini wasn't as good as others of his albums (still good but not ""wow"" enough to level up that much the overall level). Shinee album, Baekhyun and Key mini were good they kind of make up for that RV/Taeyeon/Aespa thing. I listened to NCT songs (title tracks and most b-sides on shuffle) but I don't remember much so I guess I find most of it forgettable. I loved Hyo *Second* summer bop. Overall many releases but way too many misses. *65% good*. 

Yes I genuinely think SM this year... Wasn't it. Both musically and conceptually. Red Velvet, Taeyeon and Aespa were huge disappointments for me and NCT forgettable. They have A LOT of artists so obviously they also have half of them doing very good but the ratio is definitely the worst out of the three.

unpopularkpopopinions,rq3mbq,2021-12-28 03:00:13,Twice is a bit underwhelming now,"(This opinion is controversial due to the popularity and praise of Twice’s discography, and not very many agree with me.)
I want to preface this by saying that Twice is an amazing group, and they make great music. But I’ve found that their recent works feel…flat. For context, Twice is currently transitioning from the cutesy concepts to darker, more mature ones, so they weren’t going to be perfect from the get-go but I expected slightly more based off their previous works.

Take “Cry for me” as an example. It feels like it was trying to be excitable with all its emphasized bass and electro beats, kinda like most HyunA or Stray Kids songs, Drunk-Dazed (Enhypen), Icy or Wannabe (Itzy), and others along those lines. It isn’t quite slow and rigorous either, like Move (Taemin), Lion (G-Idle) or Deja Vu (Dreamcatcher). The chorus sounds far too similar to the rest of the song for me. 

There’s enough of a difference to tell what’s a regular verse and what’s the chorus but even with the extra effects it feels too subtle. In their previous works they had changes within the song to make it more interesting and I’m just not getting that now. They still have some of the best choreography out there though.

It's gotten to the point where fans seem to think that songs like Red Velvet's Queendom, Enhypen's Tamed-Dashed, and IVE's Eleven are *boring* because they're not weird. Songs don't have to be weird or unique in order to be good.


Not to mention, whenever one of the weird, now-super-popular songs from a big group is released, the general reaction is that it's so weird and that it sucks. People only like the song after they've listened to it 50 times and have convinced themselves that they like it. Meanwhile Queendom, Tamed-Dashed, Eleven, and more weren't badly received *at all* when they were released, and people end up saying it's boring and that they didn't take risks. Groups shouldn't have to take risks or make their song strange in order for it to he good.

unpopularkpopopinions,rjujyp,2021-12-19 12:02:45,"Hybe is becoming a ""Big 4"" company.","**TLDR: While Hybe isn't a Big 4 group yet, they definitely have the group arsenal and influence to become one soon.**

While I don't think Hybe is actually part of the Big 3 or so-called ""Big 4"" lineup just yet, I definitely do think they're on their way to becoming one in the near future.

For one, BTS are definitely going down in history as one of, if not the most influential K-pop group to exist. If Big 3 are decided based on their influence and impact to the industry, BTS alone would secure Hybe's spot in that list. But only one insanely successful group isn't going to cut it... right?

TXT and Enhypen. These two are very evidently powerhouses of the 4th gen. They're talented, have massive fanbases and arguably could be leaders of their generation. I see them having incredible influence too over time.

Next, acquisitions. Acquiring Pledis means they have the powerhouse of K-pop, Seventeen, under their label. Seventeen themselves are a top boy-group, with album sales rivalled only by that of BTS themselves and NCT (who are from a Big 3 company). They too are incredibly influential. NU'EST rose up from nowhere to now become an incredibly successful group as well. They have Zico too, whose songs always do well on charts and is a talented performer/producer, and with Fromis_9 and Min Heejin's new GG (with former IZ*ONE members rumoured to join the lineup), I would say Hybe has a great catalog of groups.

As for what they bring to the table? Hybe groups popularised the ""self-producing"" concept, with BTS, Seventeen, NU'EST and Zico all being notable self-producers. They brought back bright, fresh concepts to years where boy group releases were all dark and edgy. They were the biggest force behind K-pop's success in the Western market.

Overall, Hybe definitely has the power to become a Big 4 company. They have the groups to do so, the money, and their influence is undeniable. Wouldn't be surprised at all if Hybe joins this big company lineup in the coming decade.

(Why this is unpopular: I have seen time and time again how people say that Hybe isn't part of the Big 3/4.)

unpopularkpopopinions,r7kvwi,2021-12-03 00:54:39,I don't like ENHYPEN's new hair,"I'm sorry, I had to say it. I've been feeling uncomfortable ever since they debuted their new hairstyles a couple of days ago for their 1 year anniversary, but all I can see on Twitter and the Enha sub is people going crazy about it, so I think this may be unpopular.

Members' new hair I **do** like:

Sunoo with the [black, choppy bangs.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWsP0bTBLnK/?utm_medium=copy_link) [Edgy and interesting](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1466431380431294467?s=20) and makes him stand out even more in the group for me.

Jay's [black undercut with new blonde highlights.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW0S08EBfab/?utm_medium=copy_link) The undercut and colour really [suit him so well](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1466445731976212480?s=20), he practically owns this hairstyle. I'm glad nothing much changed.

Niki back again [with black hair](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWxBcmEhxcS/?utm_medium=copy_link), the first time since I-land. [Both hairstyles look good](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1466099633629790214?s=20), but darker hair complements him better and highlights his facial features in my opinion. ~~Niki would actually do decently as a high-fashion model with his features.~~

Member's new hair I **don't** like:

Heeseung's [pinkish-red dye job](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWxBSSAhcgx/?utm_medium=copy_link). I don't know why but it makes me so uncomfortable to see such a colour on him. Maybe I'm just used to him [wearing darker colours](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1441249396620812293?s=20), but I [really don't like it](https://twitter.com/enhypen_members/status/1466447033573593091?s=21) and his attractiveness has unfortunately gone from a solid 9 to an average 6 for me :(

Sunghoon: I'm sorry but you cannot successfully convince me he looks better with [blonde hair](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1466457003794915329?s=20) than he does [with black](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1458421507655299075?s=20). He [suits the classic black look](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1450497468337061888?s=20) so much.

Jake. Dear Jake. ~~THis one hurt me.~~  He had SUCH [lovely, gorgeous dark hair.](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1454848432577810435?s=20) [He really suited being a brunette.](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1450660747822829568?s=20). Especially in [I-land](https://images.app.goo.gl/8aHMJeVAiTcErzEZ7), with his natural black hair. Now he has this [weird shade of blonde](https://twitter.com/ENHYPEN_members/status/1466427815000256517?s=20) that doesn't suit him nor his features, in my opinion.

It's not even that I hate bright colours, or blonde hair. Some of my faves' looks have been blonde or colourful. Like [Yeonjun's iconic pink hair.](https://images.app.goo.gl/gHzq9jqCYXgr25TT6) And [Suga's blonde hair.](https://images.app.goo.gl/H4DJkzJrLVshvRwS9) But ever since Enha came out with these new hairstyles, I can't stop thinking about this lmao.

unpopularkpopopinions,r2f2y4,2021-11-26 05:46:54,4th gen boy groups are doing just as well as the girl groups,"There has been something bothering me for a while. There has been a recent influx of people bragging about all these girl groups doing well on the charts. They constantly brag about how these girl groups are monster rookies. I completely agree with this statement.

I disagree with the usage of this data as an insult against boy groups. Girl groups have always done better digitally. Boy groups have always done better physically. The thing is that physical sales matter a lot more than digital charting. Charting just means that your group is well known and therefore will receive CF deals and the likes. Physical sales translate to strong fanbase which means high merchandise and concert sales. The latter brings a lot more money than the first. While CFs bring in a similar amount of money as concerts, charting well doesn't automatically mean CF deals. On the other hand, high physical sales normally mean high concert attendance and merch sales excluding anomalies. This is why companies tend to debut more boy groups than girl groups. Even when Red Velvet was considered bigger than Super Junior in 2018, Super Junior was actually making SM more money.

Yes, girl groups are having extremely high charting records but boy groups' album sales keep increasing too. Enhypen debuted this year and one of their albums have already sold 1.1 million. Stray Kids sold 1.2 million for No Easy! Boyz, TXT, and Ateez have all had an album sell over 500,000. This has to be bringing in the company a lot of money. The lack of charting barely matters since it won't affect how many people will go to a concert. IZONE (edit: and Aespa) are the only 4th generation female groups to come anywhere close to those album numbers.

My point is that while yes, the girl groups are doing amazingly, don't use those numbers to negate the boys' achievements. Both genders are achieving higher and higher numbers in either field and we should be proud of the growth.

P.S I mainly see these opinions on [r/kpop](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/) which is as girl group biased as possible, so this might actually be unpopular.

unpopularkpopopinions,qtg6vx,2021-11-14 03:39:57,I kinda hate backing tracks,"I think I’m pretty alone in this, after conversations with my few Kpop friends. They seem to think it just fills out the performance, supplements the vocals, which I can understand. I completely get why backing tracks exist, and why they’re necessary, but sometimes they really grate on me.

I mean like where there is very clearly an full backing track of the entire song playing over the performance. BUT the group is also clearly singing live on top of it. Sometimes it blends just fine, but a lot of the time, I feel like you get this weird overlay of two of the same voice and it’s just not perfectly in sync. The backing track is recorded and slightly processed, the live voice is raw, a bit shaky and breathy, sometimes off-key. And sometimes those voices just clash.

I don’t have an alternative, the majority of groups use heavy backing tracks because no matter how hard you train you just can’t sing flawlessly like the recorded song, while doing a very intense choreography, (though some groups come close). I wouldn’t want them just to sing live for that reason. But I also wouldn’t like if they just lip synced.

Some examples off the top of my head: 

This performance of drunk dazed by enhypen shows what I mean at some parts. https://youtu.be/KXOJM-Q2fzE  you can hear their live singing and the backing track at the same time and it just hits my ear wrong.

And to a lesser extent on the ground by rosé https://youtu.be/Q88P1gpOJxA  but in this case I actually think she’d be better off without the backing track. I feel like it gets in her way a bit, the choreography isn’t insane and she has a really strong live voice . The track feels like a safety net she doesn’t entirely need? Idk

Just my irrational pet peeve

unpopularkpopopinions,qrwjo3,2021-11-11 23:18:12,niziu’s chopstick is probably my favorite release of the year,"i should start with the disclaimer that i am not a fan of niziu, and this is the first song i’ve actually heard from them. i also tend to like japanese releases less, so there’s no bias in this opinion.

for some backstory on my music taste, i’ll list my favorite songs from my favorite groups:

bts - interlude shadow, outro tear, bs&t
stray kids - side effects, double knot
wayv - moonwalk
aespa - black mamba
blackpink - dkwtd
red velvet - in&out, psycho
purple kiss - crown, ponzona
gidle - oh my god (duh)

as you can see, the fact that chopstick is even in my favorites list is something even i never would have guessed, let alone being my favorite release of the year. additionally, i’m not a 2021 kpop hater like a lot of people are on this sub (which i understand to some degree). i actually enjoyed releases lately (enhypen - tamed-dashed and drunk-dazed, itzy - mitm, aespa - savage and next level), so it’s not like chopstick has no competition.

something about the piano in the chorus mixed with the funky melody makes my brain go feral. i feel like i’m being transported into some circus land and watching elephants balance on one foot. especially with the beginning piano mixed with the drums. 

anyway just wanted to say something about that song because i feel like it’s not going to spark enough conversation to scratch the itch in my brain that i have for that godsent song.

edit: kinda cheating cause this opinion is probably only unpopular because chopstick was just released. but niziu isn’t the hottest girl group right now outside of japan so i wasn’t sure if it was ever going to be talked about.

unpopularkpopopinions,qfx8i7,2021-10-26 05:06:33,ENHYPEN can’t sing very well,"
this isn’t hate in anyway but someone had to say it. not that they can’t genuinely sing because obviously they can, but if we’re being realistic, most people who hear their vocals can instantly tell that more than half the members don’t have any great skill, technique, or ability. i’m a singer myself, and they’re quite on the bottom in terms of vocal abilities. of course there’s always room for improvement but at the same time, as an idol, there shouldn’t be any excuse for awful singing when you’ve trained to become exactly that. i personally feel that the most important skill an idol shall always have is singing. like your main job is music, you’re expected to sing!! and it’s been about a year since enhypen debuted and most of them still can’t sing very well without their vocal technician tuning and pitching every SUPPOSED live performance they perform… like you can hear that robotic, vocal processing in their weekly idol performance and other shows they’ve gone on. their encores aren’t impressing either.

i say the best singer in enhypen would be heesung but even his technique can lay flat sometimes. i see him strain and struggle somewhat, but that could be because he’s nervous. jungwon’s okay, definitely wouldn’t be a lead vocalist in any other group outside of enhypen though. he still has some things to work on. his tone however may make lots of people think he’s a good vocalist because it’s unique.

sunoo, jake, and jay seem to be all on the same level of ability. i bet they can improve but that’ll take practice and dedication! i hear these 3 strain a lot. range doesn’t seem too wide and technique is unclear. they’re yet to fully control and understand their voice. there’s something really dead about their vocals compared to the expressions they make on stage, it doesn’t match up which makes me believe there’s some issues with providing the right emotions. nothing hides the fact that they need to work on it when you hear them sing.  

lastly we have niki and sunghoon. it’s hard to distinguish who’s better. their’s constant trouble when controlling voice and being generally stable without sounding like they’re struggling. they have a lot to work on.

even though enhypen aren’t the greatest singers, i bet they can improve!

edit: i already know that most kpop idols lack technique, but if some of guys really open your eyes, most of them are better than ENHYPEN. me saying ENHYPEN lack technique does not correlate to other idols who also lack technique. there is a difference between knowing how to sing and being good at singing. like rosé for example, not so good technique but she sings fine? she has a voice she can control. now compare her to jake or something…. they both lack technique and one is still clearly better than the other! some of y’all also got to understand that technique doesn’t define whether a person is good or bad at singing.

something that really disappointed me was sm having two variations for red velvets queendom come back and the photobooks were identical , like they havent had a comeback in THREE YEARS and this is what they get?? 

lately concepts have been such a big thing for groups like txt or enhypen and i feel they deliver really well with their photobooks , so overall idk i just feel we need more pretty pictures and less of full white page and a close up shot , feel free to share opinniooonssss 😁

unpopularkpopopinions,qhwv9x,2021-10-28 23:18:55,"No kpop group’s “storyline” is ever intended to have a concrete plot or any kind of resolution, it’s just to generate engagement thru fan theories","Pretty sure this got popularized thru BTS bc I remember the chokehold the HYYH music videos and content had on fans. I don’t keep up with it anymore but from what I understand there are books or webtoons that expand on the storyline. But that’s an exception and definitely not the rule bc it’s BTS. 

any other group w an extended universe (TXT, skz, enhypen, aespa) is designed to string fans along and there’s no team that’s sitting down and mapping out the storyline progression. The visuals are usually immaculate and videos are filled with easter eggs and references to past MVs but like that’s it....

This is maybe unpopular bc I see more fans indulging the storylines (understandably) and trying to comprehend them more than I see them criticize it. 

so many comments are like “oh i’m just too dumb to understand their storyline” no. you just were never supposed to. you were supposed to do the company’s dirty work yourself by reading and writing dissertations on your theories and never get any official resolution

It makes sense, you as a company cannot predict a lot of variables such as future budget, the groups popularity, etc so i don’t think it’s laziness I just think it’s a marketing ploy. I do think if the storyline and universe were more concrete it would garner more attention but whos to say. Also disclaimer I am not familiar with LOONA’s concept so maybe they could be another exception to what I’m talking about.

unpopularkpopopinions,qfllo4,2021-10-25 19:18:18,Album repackages in kpop are starting to get tiresome,"Repackages have always been a thing in kpop, but with more and more groups jumping on the train to increase album sales, I'm just getting tired of them as a whole. Also before anyone starts getting upset, some of my own fave artists use these and I still don't like them. 

They offer usually nothing more interesting than the original, and the extra tracks included could've easily just been on the original lineup. The only track off a recent kpop album repackage that was 100% worth it was probably Loser Lover which I liked better than 0x1. However even then, we didn't  need a whole ass repackage for like 2-3 more songs, even though they were great. 

They're just around to boost album sales which are basically already inflated due to the use of multiple versions of albums, randomized photo cards, cheaper jewel case versions, and etc. Like we already are boosting album sales through those which are like, okay fine. I'm not mad about that, respect the hustle as I've hears before.

But do we really need repackages to boost sales more? And I know they've been a thing for a while in kpop but god with the realization that Enhypen's recent album will probably have a repackage too, I feel like I'm getting too much of them.

unpopularkpopopinions,q868af,2021-10-14 20:56:25,There isn't a massive hate train for enhypen,"So I have been seeing this opinion a lot on kpop reddit and I simply just don't get it I hear a lot of engenes saying there is a hate train towards enhypen and it's simply not just true

If you search enhypen on kpop thoughts what you get is appreciation posts with tons of awards and massive upvotes [evidence 1](https://imgur.com/QlQWy5u), [evidence 2](https://imgur.com/tJifrXn),  and if you search on kpop rants it's people asking people to stop hating on them [evidence 1](https://imgur.com/C2iyuNC) and [evidence 2](https://imgur.com/tlPL27l) and on UKO obviously, the posts on them are going to be sort of negative it's an unpopular opinion sub for a reason enhypen gets a lot of praise so the unpopular things about them are going to be negative.

They had that n word controversy and that sunoo thing and there was discourse on that and I won't call it a hate train because it was people simply discussing and giving their opinions on the issue.

Engenes act like people have a hate boner for enhypen or something like that when in reality they don't receive as much hate as engenes say they do.

Enhypen had a hit song, are a big 4 group from hybe and are doing extremely well for a 4th gen bg rookie obviously there is going to be discourse and different opinions on them and that isn't a hate boner people are always going to talk about popular groups

You are a stan so you are more sensitive and are going to see the few negative posts as something bigger than it is but as someone who isn't a stan and scrolls through the subs there really isn't a hate boner against them

Someone saying enhypen has bad music or that they are boring or that their fans are mass buying ISN'T a hate train at all it isn't even hate it's just giving their opinions and as we all know opinions arent facts and can always be wrong this is reddit not twitter

I think this is unpopular because this is a popular thing now that x group is getting a hate train omg everyone hates them

unpopularkpopopinions,qbecn1,2021-10-19 17:50:59,Idol Room was better than the new Weekly Idol,"Alternative title: I liked Idol Room better than the new Weekly Idol.

**Please just answer based on the title and not on the details in the post (I really want to see which is the most liked so even if you don't agree with the details of my post don't take those into account while answering).**

I know that it's pointless to do this now considering that Idol Room (IR) has ended but I was still curious to see which show between IR and Weekly Idol (WI) fans prefer. Since Doni and Coni (D&C) are widely hated across the Kpop fandom (especially by ifans) and WI's MCs get praised a lot I thought it would be appropriate to post this here. 

So, I tried to watch the StayC episode on WI to get to know them. I used to do that when D&C used to MC for WI and I always had a good time watching whatever idol that was on, so I thought it would be the same. But after 10 minutes I just gave up (I watched the rest later and watch Enhypen's latest episode but it just wasn't great). Idk if it was my bias for D&C or if it was bc StayC are still rookies, but the atmosphere was really awkward. I just couldn't bear it.

I thought it would fun to ""compare"" WI and IR by watching one episode from each with the same guests (an established group) from the same time period to see if IR was really ""better"" or not (it's all subjective so it's ultimately pointless but whtvr). Since I don't know anything about Gfriend I thought it would be a good idea to see which show would be able to entertain me despite my lack of knowledge on the group. So I decided to watch the Gfriend episodes from the same period (IR ep86 and WI ep447).

I tried to give WI as much chance as possible (watch the episode first so I wouldn't be influenced by IR or get 'GF fatigue') but it just couldn't entertain me at all. After 15 minutes I became really bored bc they spent 10min on the same boring corner (the face window thing). IR had a similar corner but it somehow felt more entertaining.
I started to feel bored 30min into IR but it was mostly due to fatigue from watching the two episodes back to back, not bc it wasn't funny.

I know humour is subjective but 5min into IR and I already laughed more than while watching WI for 50min. I only really laughed once thanks to Yerin(?) ""meditating"" during the random play dance. It's unfair to compare them but professional MCs and comedians are just on a different level from idols that MC. Kwanghee and Eunhyuk try to be funny but everything somehow feels flat to me.

Overall it also felt like GF were more relaxed/free(?) during IR (I know it's dumb to analyse this heavily edited footage but it still felt like it): talked freely among themselves, interacted with the MCs and dissed them...

In conclusion, it felt like I had to be a GF stan to be able to enjoy WI, while I still enjoyed myself watching IR despite not knowing anything about GF (watching IR I thought GF were a lot funnier then I thought after that WI episode). Being able to attract non fans is what those idol shows should aim to do in my opinion so IR was a better show in that aspect (as a fan I don't want to go to WI just to watch my faves, I can already watch their own content).

At the end of the day the success of the show relies 60% on the writers and the current WI writers are not doing a great job in my opinion. Now that IR is no more I really wished MBC hired the IR writers back so we could have an entertaining show with MCs that get the ""unproblematic"" stamp from ifans.

Edit: the opinion is not whether you like D&C more than Kwanghee and Eunhyuk, but whether IR/old WI was better than the new WI, so that include the MCs, writing and corners, and general entertainment each show provides. So even if you hate D&C that doesn't mean that you will find their show worse than the new WI with MCs that you love/find unproblematic. Just like how despite my strong dislike for JK Rowling, I like Harry Potter more than 50shades even if I have no issue with EL James.

unpopularkpopopinions,p84ma0,2021-08-20 14:54:57,Each member in a Kpop group should have a distinct voice,"**I think that each member in a Kpop group should have a distinct voice in their songs because:**

**It sounds better, unique, and more memorable.** The editing of each member's voices in songs can make them sound in tune, but I think that having a voice that sounds different from the other members in a Kpop group is the best way to stand out, especially in larger groups.

Speaking of larger groups, I think **larger Kpop groups would benefit more with distinct voices** because I'm sure many Kpop singers prefer to be known for their singing as the years go by.

**Members who sound similar are hard to tell apart**, so it can make it hard for listeners to recognize who is singing during the first time they listen to their songs. With distinct voices, listeners can tell who is singing much more easily.

For those who think that listeners should just listen more closely and that they don't sound the same, yes, I agree, but sometimes it could take more than 2 playbacks to really hear who is singing what line for some Kpop groups.

**Distinct voices will be one more reason that prevents fans from saying how all boy groups or all girl groups that recently debuted are becoming the same lately.** I remember seeing some posts a few months ago about this. I don't really think so because each group has their own concepts, but if it's related to the sound of their voices, I would agree on this unpopular opinion. I also saw posts saying how Kpop is becoming too westernized, I don't really care as long as there's still good songs out there. After all, different cultures influence each other. It's no longer back in the day when Kpop music had its own ""bubble"" where entertainment companies didn't need to think about targeting international fans. Obviously, there's several lesser-known groups out there who have their unique style, so for those who mainly listen to well-known groups, try listening to more groups!

**In conclusion, I think that entertainment companies should consider having all members with distinct voices when forming a Kpop group if they want each member to share the spotlight in the eyes of fans including all the reasons above.** In the end, as a listener, sometimes I don't really care if they sound unique as long as their songs sound good, but when I want to learn more about each member and when I want to know who is singing upon hearing the first or second playback, this is where the problem begins.

**Examples of Kpop Groups:**

**""Pass""** means that the group has enough distinct voices, and **""no pass""** means the group should have had more distinct voices or should cut down on the autotune, if there was any. A pass is given if half or more of the group members’ voices can be easily identified on the first or second listen. This is rated based on how listeners would notice the distinctness of voices upon listening to songs for the first or second time. **Think of it like playing a game where you have to guess how many singers are in a song. If you can identify the correct number of voices you can hear in a song, then the more of a reason that the group deserves a pass.** As you listen to it more than three times, you’ll definitely notice the slight differences among voices, which defeats the purpose of these ratings. 

**Ateez:** I think their voices seem to have some editing in terms of members with deeper voices. Think of their choruses in songs like Say My Name and you'll get what I mean. I can tell apart some voices like Hongjoong, Jongho, and Mingi. I give them a **partial pass**. Nonetheless, their songs are good and one of the groups that I've been following their music for a while!

**Blackpink:** All 4 members sound unique since I remember confidently listening to their comeback songs knowing that I can tell who is singing! I give this group a **pass**!

**BTS:** A **pass** because their voices are all unique! The rap line and the vocal line members all have their own distinct voices, but if I were to really say who among them sounds similar, I could confuse myself between Suga and J-Hope on the first listen, but I think that was just for a few songs.

**Treasure:** I think most of the members have a unique voice so I can tell who is singing most of the time. Back when they had their comebacks, for the most part, I remembered I didn't know whether Jae Hyuk or Do Young sang their parts yet. Since this is a 12-member group which is considered large, I think this group deserves a **pass**.

**Twice:** I think that their songs do have more of a youthful vibe when they debuted, I know they have shifted their style more recently, but I think that on the first listen, their voices sound indistinguishable on the first and second listen. In fact, I must look up the lyrics to really see who is singing what line. I think Nayeon and Jihyo sound similar which is why they also sing the choruses often too! I give this group a **no pass**.

Please let me know your thoughts by commenting below. Feel free to suggest more examples too and if you give them a **pass** or a **no pass**!

.............................................................................................................................................................................

EDIT: Here are examples suggested by u/me_a_photato, u/lunataurus27, u/OkAyNd, and u/itzirenebae:

**Enhypen** and **TXT**: Their vocal tones are very similar to each other and can be monotone. For Enhypen, think of the chorus in their song called Drunk-Dazed. You'll get what I mean by ""that"" kind of vocal sound. As for TXT, Yeonjun's voice is more distinguished among the TXT members, and for Enhypen I also think their voices are hard to tell apart. I think the heavy editing can be one of the reasons for this. I give these two groups a **no pass**.

**(G)I-dle**: Most of the members have unique voices which deserves a **pass**. Think of their song Dahlia and you'll enjoy hearing their distinct and unique voices, particularly between Minnie, Miyeon, Soyeon, and Yuki.

**Purple Kiss**: This group is also a great example of a group with distinct voices. Swan is one of the main vocalists of Purple Kiss and the maknae has one of the most unique voices. No rating was assigned by me because I don’t know all the members’s names and voices. 

2nd EDIT:

**Aespa**: u/kaguraa suggested this one, they are already a small group and I think Ningning is the only member that stands out the most to me. I give this group a **partial pass**.

**Bigbang**: u/skeptical_cell suggested this one which I think deserves a **pass** too! G-Dragon has a really unique voice in particular, his ballads sound amazing as well.

**Day6**: u/Alternative-Pie4914 suggested this one and for me, I think Jae and Wonpil's voices are the ones I remember the most. I give this group a **pass** as well.

**Mamamoo**: u/tasoula suggested this one, I agree and give a **pass** because I can tell who is singing out of all 4 members.

**Iz*One**: u/Yromas suggested this one, I've only listened to a few of their songs and I think they deserve a **no pass** because it is very difficult to separate different voices.

3rd EDIT:

**Stray Kids**: Thanks to u/stvntr, u/gongjihae, u/sarabear169, and u/its_tabby_kat7, I also agree that Stray Kids deserves a **pass** because at least half of the members have distinct voices. To me, Felix and Seungmin’s voices stand out a lot too.

**Red Velvet**: u/Melon13579, u/helily, and u/RebootingMako suggested this one, I agree their voices are quite distinguishable and blend well! The harmonies and solo parts all sound great for several of their songs. I give this group a **pass**.

**EXO**: u/winterlevi and u/Melon13579 suggested this one, I debated including this one above because I have listened to several of each solo member's songs so I already knew I'd recognize their voices upon the first/second listen of their most recent title track song Don't Fight the Feeling earlier this year. I give this group a **pass**.

unpopularkpopopinions,ovudm7,2021-08-01 17:41:07,TXTs Stylists Are Holding Them Back,"I don't know if holding them back is the right word because that's pretty dramatic (TXT are extremely successful regardless) but I can't help but feel like their stage outfits take away from their amazing performances. I'm the type of K-Poppie who LOVES stage performances the best out of all aspects of K-Pop and it's usually these stage performances that determine whether or not I Stan a group, however I find TXTs outfits to be cringey and immature most of the time, especially compared to a group like Itzy or Enhypen who's outfits consistently fit with the groups theme and the vibe of the track they are performing. Most of the time, I don't even know what TXTs stylists are thinking; the outfits the boys wear don't really make sense on their own and they make even less sense when you consider their personalities and individual styles. To some people, outfits might not matter but for me, a bad outfit takes away from the cohesion of the stage and pulls me out of an otherwise engaging performance. Because of this I tend to watch dance practices a lot more instead since their outfits don't matter as much and fit their personalities more since it's just something they'd normally wear.

This opinion is unpopular because i don't know if people pay attention to outfits as much as I do and it's not a conversation I've seen had anywhere

unpopularkpopopinions,om6zsb,2021-07-17 18:00:41,Enhypen's discography is interchangeable with TommorowXTogether's," I'm not sure where this sub would stand on this, but I don't think it'll go down well in their respective subs, understandably. 

Enhypen is a newer group, so we have yet to see how they will change  and progress in the coming years, but at the moment I find their music  to be similar with TXT's. 

I've loved both groups since their debut, so it's just double the  music I like, win-win. But if I imagine their songs performed by TXT, I  can easily make that adjustment and be like ""oh yeah that sounds like a  lyric Soobin would sing in falsetto"". At first I thought maybe their  voices sounded similar, or I just didn't listen enough of Enhypen to be  able to distinguish the voices. And I think there is also a kind of  voice effect that the songs are made with that makes their styles blend  for me. (I think Flicker uses it alot and made it hard to distinguish  the voices at first, and I just super want to hear the character in  their voices plz thanks).

I do hope there will be a comeback where I'm like 'ohhh THIS is  Enhypen, this is their style', but so far, although they release  bangers, I don't get a sense of what sets them apart musically from TXT.

personally, i think it's not that good and i think the [HYPE](https://zapzee.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EyTLWqsUcAwf_Dr-scaled.jpeg) and [DOWN](https://dbkpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ENHYPEN_Border_Carnival_Teaser_Down_all_group_1.jpg) versions are far superior in styling, especially the DOWN version. it's not talked about enough despite how genuinely pleasing the photos and styling is to look at. like at least some people talk about the HYPE version because of the iconic high school party aesthetic... but dude, you're missing out with DOWN.

the prince outfits in the UP version look kind of costumey to me. i'm also just not a fan of the colours either, i don't like how bright the shades of blue they use are since they're trying to make them look mature and elegant. i feel like a more muted colour would've worked more in their favour. [sunghoon](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/76/1c/77761c24948b0f796fed413f9d4df99a.jpg) and [jake's](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyyYNQqXAAY87MR.jpg) outfits are the ones i liked the most out of them all because they were black/looked more black.

it also just looks kind of out-of-place. like why am i seeing a 15 year old kid dressed like he's a founding father??

but enough negativity about UP, let me explain why DOWN is the best. the colour scheme? immaculate, i love the grays, blacks, whites and blues. it does such a good job in creating a theme and atmosphere that i can practically SMELL the concept photos, and it smells like paint. is that just me being weird? probably. is it cool as shit though? yeah duh.

and the OUTFITS!! they're more creative, they're not just easy ensembles you piece together, there's a lot more details and fun with styling outfits like the ones in the DOWN version. my favourite has to be [sunoo's](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9d/fd/9a/9dfd9a6e0dcf93377fa41e0111c95470.jpg), the black short-sleeved blazer looks great on him and the way his hair is styled compliments it all. IT'S JUST SUCH A LOOK!

unpopularkpopopinions,omn2ug,2021-07-18 11:06:08,Groups being close or not shouldn’t matter or affect them in any way.,"Let me explain a little bit if you don’t get it. What I mean is that if a group is close/super close to one another or they aren’t and are just semi close, it shouldn’t matter at all. I made this post because I forgot where but I saw a comment saying enhypen not being close with each other is why they aren’t that interesting to watch or stan.  I’ve never understood why it’s such a big deal if members in groups are super close or close to each other. Of course I would want everyone to get along with each other, be semi close to not make every time they film something together awkward and forced and respect one another, however I don’t see it as big deal if they are super duper close or not. Because at the end of the day it’s basically a job to earn money and entertain people and to make music for sales and charts. It doesn’t make me feel weird  when watching a group do a certain thing together if they aren’t close. As someone who stans a lot of groups who are fairly close I still didn’t or wouldn’t care if the group was close or not because I’m here for the music and the talent and the members respecting each other. I think pushing the idea that groups should be super close is wrong because not everyone is going to get along with each other all the time and some people are naturally just not the type to be super super close with a person even if they’ve known then all their life and are fairly uncomfortable with that , which is me because yes I’m close to them in terms of friends wise but I’m not showing my affection every second or touchy. I still want them to respect each other but if a group has a coworker type of closeness it shouldn’t matter or affect them and if the group has a best friends for life then it shouldn’t matter of effect then as well. Whatever works for the idols/group they should do and fans shouldn’t really interfere with that.

I think companies should put more effort into music and mvs than content on social media

I much prefer if a group has quality music and less content. This means not as many scandals and people will kind of forget about you, yet you're still relevant especially when your comeback is around.

Enhypen and nct just happen to have good music and a heck of a lot of content.

The more content you have, the more fans, but you can only have so many. People don't want vloggers, they want kpop idols.

Having a limited amount of comebacks is also a really smart move, in my opinion, it makes people anticipate.

unpopularkpopopinions,odsaod,2021-07-04 22:24:42,Enhypen is really boring imo,"my whole friend group are big engenes, so naturally im one too. but one problem is that i cant watch their yt content for the life of me. to clarify, by 'yt content' i mean  enhypen&hi, en-o-clock, and mini olympics. yk.

 all that just bores the heck out of me. enhypen&hi especially makes me want to fall asleep, it could just be that im not far enough in the series yet but im bored out of my mind to even continue watching. id chuckle like once which is v different compared to how much i laugh when i watch other kpop groups' content. for reference, id often pause the video to process and laugh even more. none of their personalities stands out either which is why i dont have a strong bias (as of rn my biases are niki and jungwon).

i think the problem is either enhypen tries too hard to be funny or that my sense of humor is different. perhaps they're not chaotic enough for my liking.? like i get their jokes but its just not amusing to me. for example, when the boys were impersonating eachother in ep 3 of en-o-clock. i get what they're doing but its not making me rofl if that makes sense...

these boys are really talented and handsome. i love their music alot too. i just cant connect or relate to them like how my friends do. im guessing this is unpopular because all my friends think they're hilarious. but they're just so bland to me and i wanna see if others think so too or if its just me. 

maybe you guys can recommend me some fun clips to change my mind because i really want enhypen to mean alot to me<3

i already experienced my ults and many groups i stan competing on kingdom, and while there were some rough ups and downs i personally experienced, i think the show itself wasn't that bad. it was just mostly the fans that i had issues with. i actually really liked the interactions between all the groups and of course the crazy performances were fun to watch.

and so that's why i want to see enhypen, p1harmony and treasure go on kingdom now. imagine jongseob reuniting with ygtb boys, or the maknaes being adopted/switched over. niki would be adopted by treasure j-line for sure! jay and hyunsuk the bullied hyungs would get along really well too, probably talk about their troublesome kids like chan and hongjoong did ahahaha.

the genius behind Can't You See Me, the inventor of bops, the icon of growth

from the people who gave you movies (not mvs), a beautiful storyline, and most importantly, cowboy yeonjun!

the team behind txt is sent from the Heavens  (especially my girl Adora).

so tell me, how did we go from pictures like [this](https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/07083358/arcadia_group_05.jpg), and [this](https://6.viki.io/image/d6be4fedc25449ea94ea4149fe587870.jpeg?s=900x600&e=t) to pictures like [this](https://dbkpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/txt_the_dream_chapter_eternity_teaser_port_all_5-2000x1333.jpg)?!

the album eternity is everything i could have asked for. cant you see me is my favourite title track of all time. eternally is one of the most unique b-sides i've heard. YEONJUN PUMA RAP IS PALYING IN MY HEAD 24/7,,,, but will i buy the physical album? most likely never.

that is because the album kind of repulsive to look at...

&#x200B;

lets look at port concept photos first because its the worse out of the two versions. this is the link for all the concept photos btw: [https://txt.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Dream\_Chapter:\_ETERNITY/Gallery#Promotional\_Pictures](https://txt.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dream_Chapter:_ETERNITY/Gallery#Promotional_Pictures)

they're just looking sad on the bus. that's it. it's boring. i'm bored. and i'm never bored of anything txt related! ugh this makes me sad. the seats of this bus give a really artificial orange hue to the pictures. and it's not a nice hue like a sunset. [still dreaming](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Epbbrq2UYAANO8o.jpg), and their [photobooks](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQL5x0wUEAAROM-.jpg)(H:OUR) use nice sunset hues.

these two pictures i showed you manage to make the worst color combination look beautiful: purple and orange. it is so difficult to make purple and orange look good together in an artificial sense (isn't using sunset hues). thankfully, they didn't saturate soobin's hair color further to make it vibrant purple or else i wouldn't be able to look at the pictures.

the clothes are so boring, the way they sit boring. these pictures are not telling me a story. it's really disappointing to look at. i don't want to look at these pictures because they don't make me feel anything. i don't care about this.

&#x200B;

now let's look at starboard.

this one isn't too bad. i love the set design. they're in this rooftop glasshouse kinda thing and they're looking at the beautiful night sky. i love it. so pretty. and they're wearing sailor uniforms. that's so cute. like they're cruising the night sky. i love it.

so what's the problem? the problem is that while they didn't oversaturate soob's hair for port, they made an oopsie with yeonjun and taehyun. the color scheme of these pictures are the miraculous deep blues, and these pictures have a wonderful NATURAL deep purple hue. its unfortunate because the color scheme gets interrupted by the vibrancy of [yeonjun and taehyun's hair.](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b2/0a/64/b20a64e019a224f0235561de70fd4928.jpg) now, it's not TOO bad but it does stick out. yeonjun's light hair makes him look like a neon yellow highlighter, completely contrasting him from the peaceful deep blues and purples of the scenery. taehyun's hair isn't too light colored, but there is literally no other form of red in these pictures.

thankfully, these pictures are telling me a story. it looks comfortable to be in that space, and it feels like one warm hug in the cold night. it gives these vibes of 5 young children looking out into the vast unknown.

but i'm not a fan of this version having a white cover, while the pictures are really dark. the contrast is ugly. they should've given this version the purple color and port (which has lighter hues) the white one. but of course, they chose to give the purple cover to the orange themed album (the color combination that i despise the most in this world)

&#x200B;

oh, but we're not done yet. i have to rant about the inclusions.

before i do, just wanted to mention that the postcard and lock and key idea was amazing and i loved it.

now, if i were a collector, i wouldn't want to collect any of these [polaroids or photocards.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EY12CobUMAA1p-2.jpg:large) for the photocards, i really don't like this half and half thing they're doing. one half is a selfie, other is a concept picture. its so weird. they could have two separate cards for each member. this is what they did for enhypen in their [border:carnival album.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ez_UFdRVkAkdBde.jpg:large) 9 cards per member for 7 members= 63 cards! as opposed to 3 cards per member for 5 members= 15 cards only...

i really dislike the transparent photocards. they can be done well! they did it well for the id cards in blue hour. but here, they look almost fanmade.

&#x200B;

anyways, i'm glad they stepped it up with blue hour and (dare i say) blue hour gave us the best concept photos so far (especially the R version!). the color schemes are beautiful and there is no clash between the background and the member's features (like how yeonjun's hair in starboard didn't suit the background). in this case, [yeonjun's pink cotton candy hair actually suited the blue backdrop really well.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjA2v9jXgAQmAAq.jpg) great design choices! there's no way to go but up from here :)

&#x200B;

now, i know you're thinking that i'm nit-picking. but honestly, from a design perspective, this isn't nitpicking, this is just analysing what went wrong. any other design enthusiasts here wanna add anything? again, not a professional so if you liked these pictures do talk about it in the comments!

take care yall!

obligatory UKO stuff so i dont get removed:

why do i think this opinion is unpopular? because nobody EVER talks about the design and photography of this album. in blue hour, the concept design was so fabulous it was the talk of the town. that's how great your design should be.

where do i think this opinion is unpopular? i mean, amongst fans, usually they won't care about the design aspects. why do you think pre-orders exist? fans trust that the album will look nice and also they may not care for the design aspects they just wanna support the group...

unpopularkpopopinions,nwwrru,2021-06-10 21:53:13,Given-Taken >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Drunk-Dazed,"Let me start by saying that I love Drunk-Dazed and everything about it from concept to choreography, I listen to it everyday and it's one of my favourites comebacks from this year. 

It was an amazing first comeback for Enhypen, it's was very successful, they gained a lot of fans and attention, and music shows wins with this comeback and I'm really happy for them.

But as a song, I prefer Given-Taken. The opening already grabs you with the instrumental  and Heeseung's ""wake up in day one"", the song follows with Sunoo, Jay and Jake and then there's Sunghoon in the pre-chorus and it's just so nice, i swear all this first verse is a masterpiece, their voices and the instrumental combine so well (I hope this makes sense lol). But what I really love about this song is the chorus, both first and second chorus, the melodies are so nice and catchy, the members voices one after another blend really well, I replay the chorus at least 10 times in a row before letting the song proceed to the next section because it's just that damm nice. The bridge with Sunghoon and Ni-ki is iconic and the final chorus with Heeseung going crazy with the adlibs in the background is just beautiful.

I think this opinion might be unpopular because almost every SNS I go, majority of people prefer Drunk-Dazed. It's seems many people found Given-Taken boring and too dark (concept wise) for a debut and prefer the energy of Drunk-Dazed more which is totally valid as we all have different tastes. I personally like Given-Taken more, it was favourite debut song from last year and in top3 songs overall from last year with Can't you see me and How you like that being top 1 an 2.

About the albums, I can't pick a favourite, I Iike all the songs in both albums the same!! Can't wait for Enhypen future releases, they became one of my favourite groups, their songs are totally my style. I hope their next album is a full length one!!

I think the EDM chorus especially ruins any sexy vibes for me, it sounds too bright and upbeat. Don’t get me wrong, I love this song to death! But I think of sexy songs as songs I can sexy dance to, and that just isn’t BS&T.

It was also a great way to discover new groups. And it’s not like there’s a lack of tier 2 boy bands to participate. Off the top of my head, there’s Treasure, Enhypen, Cravity, Ghost 9, even TxT.

Also, RTK did my boys TO1 dirty by having them on before they even debuted. I’d love to see them now they at least have a couple of singles under their belt.

The only thing they should change is the elimination. There’s no need for it tbh.

Edit: heyyyyy tier 2 is not a bad thing. Imho, the only tier 1 groups are BTS, Stray Kids, Ateez and EXO, along with some of the older groups like SHINee.

unpopularkpopopinions,npi4k3,2021-06-01 03:07:57,Complimenting a group on their “versatility” is hollow in terms of the K-Pop industry.,"New(er) to the general KPop fandom. Been more of a k-hip hop guy than anything: P1Harmony, ONF, MCND, and PURPLE KISS were the only ones I regularly listened to before just recently, but ITZY’s Mafia In The Morning and the recent drops from PIXY and GWSN are all really interesting and attention grabbing. It’s telling me that there’s more to be interested in in terms of KPop.

That being said, I was listening to the TXT album today. It’s very hit or miss in my opinion, but I saw a lot of people calling this proof of TXT’s versatility. It’s true that there are many different styles on the album, but when I really thought about it, it was much more complicated than that.

First of all, I’d like to put down this clarifier. Versatility is not talent. Those two are very, if not completely separate. They may not be mutually exclusive, but they are different things. One can dabble in many genres and be alright at them, and one can be amazing at one genre.

There is no KPop group without talent. It’s extremely rare to be able to single someone out in a group as squarely bad. They can be subpar at a specific role, such as when dancers are thrown into the position of rapper when a song calls for it, but overall these people are here because of their talent. You all know how the idol industry is: if they weren’t talented enough, they wouldn’t be there.

It’s easy to be versatile as a 6, 7, 8 member group. You have a rap banger? Rappers will be the main star. A ballad? Vocalist time, maybe a rap verse in the second verse or bridge. There’s almost always someone to cover up someone’s weakness, and that can lead to a lot of possibilities independent of how versatile the individual members are. Versatile members of a group exist. Yuki from PURPLE KISS, Jiung from P1Harmony, and Lola from PIXY are just a couple of examples. But they aren’t versatile because they’re choosing to do a rap verse here and a singing part here, they’re versatile because they can work with what they’re given and be good at it all the same.

This could be seen as a separate hot take, but I’ll just condense it here and you guys can take it how you like: Producers and songwriters are kingmakers for most KPop groups. Talent is a constant when it comes to the members, but production quality is something that is much more subjective and something that varies much more than talent.

And with so many people on the credits list, especially with the larger groups like ENHYPEN, aespa, and TXT, it’s difficult for me to believe that the members themselves have much creative freedom, especially when it’s generally rare to see the names of those members on the song’s credits. They’re much less personally attached to the production of their music than Khiphop artists are.

I don’t think TXT chose to have Olly Murs help write Magic. I don’t think they chose to have the songwriting group danke write almost every single track on this album. It feels like they were given lyrics and an instrumental, and they were capable of performing the script they got because of how talented they were. They may not be forced to perform anything they actively dislike, but there’s a reason that so many people call KPop soulless, lacking in personality: it sounds like it was made for an audience, made for the mainstream, not made for the members of the group.

It isn’t the case with every group, and we obviously won’t ever truly know if it is, but it feels like the case with most I listen to. And that isn’t a condemnation: if your music is good, I’ll listen to it. But if you’re going to compliment a group on their versatility, compliment the producers, the arrangers, the composers, the mixers, the writers, because more likely than not they’re the ones who determine how that group sounds.

unpopularkpopopinions,nerrsf,2021-05-17 23:01:31,"While I like every Enhypen member's vocal tone/voice, my personal favorite voice/vocal tone is Jake's","After lurking for so long, I finally worked up the courage to post something here. Here it goes: 

&#x200B;

Personally, I really like all of the Enhypen members' voices/vocal tones (I am not talking about technique—I understand they all have room for improvement—although, I also think too many people on kpop reddit use ""vocal analyses"" to mask what is essentially still a subjective opinion…but I will save that for a different opinion post). This in it of itself seems to be a pretty unpopular opinion on the kpop subreddits that I have lurked on because it seems like many people think they all sound the same. 

&#x200B;

However, I will take it one step further. While I do enjoy all members' voices, my personal favorite vocal tone/voice is Jake's. 

&#x200B;

**1.** **This seems to be unpopular amongst Engenes and Non-Engenes**

I am pretty sure this unpopular inside and outside the fandom. 

&#x200B;

Amongst Engenes, particularly on Reddit, but also other platforms, people tend to gravitate toward Heeseung's voice, Jungwon's voice, or Sunoo's voice. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that because I can definitely see the appeal for all three of their voices. Heeseung has very trendy tone that he can stylize to fit any genre and sound great. Jungwon has a very unique and almost nasal (in a good way) quality to his voice, and he has an impressive amount of control over it when performing intense choreography. And Sunoo has a great lower register that I love to listen too. Please understand I also love Jay's voice, Ni-Ki's voice, and Sunghoon's voice, but I was just naming the three I see people tend to gravitate toward the most. 

&#x200B;

Amongst non-Engenes, as I said above, many people think they all sound the same, but it seems like non-Engenes can differentiate Jungwon's voice the most often. I think Heeseung trends for his voice sometimes as well, so I would say non-Engenes would probably pick one of those two, if they picked anyone’s voice at all. Also, I would say that non-Engenes are not the friendliest when expressing opinions of Jake generally. I don't really understand it, but people really love to circulate a particular gif and MR removed videos of him. So, even if I am wrong about whose voice non-Engenes prefer, I am pretty confident it is not Jake’s.

&#x200B;

**2.**  **Why I like Jake’s voice the best?**

When talking about ""who has the best voice"" or ""who is the best dancer,"" I think opinions are always going to be subjective. My opinion is no different. I recognize it is 100% subjective, and I am totally okay if a lot of people disagree with me. However, if you give me a whole vocal analysis on why X member is technically a better singer, it will likely have very little effect on me because this is my opinion on what I like to listen to the best, not who I think demonstrates the most technical ability. 

&#x200B;

Also, Jake is my bias—I will fully admit that. But, my favorite member's dancing style is Ni-ki's (followed by Sunghoon's), so I'd like to think my subjective opinion is not totally biased. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I think Jake has a really beautiful voice. At times it can be very soft, but other times there are hints of a raspy quality in some of his lines, particularly his live/raw vocals. Also, his pronunciations sound guttural sometimes, which I think adds texture to his lines. Here are videos of [Enhypen's encore performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX8McYBHPVU) and [Not For Sale performance on MBC radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_ogtDlvI5g) that I think demonstrate these qualities. 

&#x200B;

I also think his falsettos sound lovely. There is recent video from Rolling's [Transonglation](https://youtu.be/6gsJOea9hUM?t=341) that demonstrates this (I am aware that they may be using mics with pitch correction processors, but I still think it is closer to a raw vocal than the studio version and showcases his falsettos nicely). 

&#x200B;

His voice also works well in harmonization with other members. Sometimes when two distinct voices try to harmonize, or even just sing together, I don't love how they blend, but I think Jake's voice goes really well with all the other members' voices. Particularly, his and Jungwon's blend well, which was unexpected for me because Jungwon's tone is so distinct that I thought his voice would sound overpowering. Here is a [very short clip](https://youtu.be/1PwXuLGoVBc?t=55) of him and Jungwon singing together. 

&#x200B;

Also, it seems like he is really working on improving his range and styling techniques, so I am excited to see how his voice evolves. As his confidence as has grown, his live singing has improved as well, so I am looking forward to him continuing to improve. But overall, I just really like how his voice sounds. 

&#x200B;

I'll stop here because this is probably way too much for an opinion post, but I just wanted to make sure I explained myself/followed the posting rules. I am not sure if I put the correct flair, so please correct me if I am wrong.  I’m a bit nervous, but I am happy I finally chose to post something here.

unpopularkpopopinions,nkfhxc,2021-05-25 04:59:08,I don't like the direction HYBE is taking most of their groups," I think they're trying to appeal to the Western audience so much to the point where it's starting to lose it's appeal to me.

First up is the big boys, BTS. I haven't been excited for a BTS major comeback since Fake Love. I think their new music video directors are worse than the old ones. It seems more gimmicky, and overall more focused on looking cinematic and high-budget than actually having artistic merit and sticking to a concept. I don't like the way they're doing their music production. Dynamite was outsourced, meaning the group themselves were not involved in the production or writing of the song. I don't have an opinion on Butter yet, but all I can say is that I wasn't very hyped for it. As for ON, while the choreography was impressive, the song is overly compressed to the point where I thought my headphones were broken the first time I heard it. This leaves notably, Black Swan, which I very much enjoyed. The problems I'm talking about were absent, which leads me to think they did it olin their old process.

Next up, Seventeen. Honestly I've been loving the mixtape so far, but as for their group projects, they've seemed really much less remarkable than their older stuff. Every Seventeen song is loaded with pure emotion. Whether that emotion be joy an happiness in their boy-crush concept songs like Adore U, pure passion like FEAR or Thanks, longing and sadness like Don't Wanna Cry, or pure fucking hype like in HIT, their music is just intense. This direction I attribute largely to the amount of creative control the group has enjoyed while under only Pledis. For better or for worse Seventeen has essentially managed themselves for a long time and I fear HYBE doing what big executives usually want to do - taking the creativity away. So far I'm happy to say that this hasn't been the case for the mixtape, but we'll see what the future holds.

TXT - honestly I have no idea where this group is going and I never really have. I could never get into the style. As performers they're all very strong especially for their age, but I feel like it's being kinda wasted. The concept is weak because it's just not clearly defined. I feel like BigHit doesn't really know where they're going with them either. This is not surprising as BigHit have historically relied on self-producing and artist involvement in the process. TXT is their first fully ""manufactured"" group.

Enhypen is the one which actually seems promising. I'm worried about their branding catching on abroad but this sort of duality thing they've got going on is interesting and the songs themselves are very well thought out. Here comes the catch though. This is a joint project between HYBE and CJ E&M and I'm not sure how much to attribute to the latter. Since the style seems closer to the traditional K-Pop formula marketed towards the Korean market.

And that's my spiel. Basically I've been noticing this for about a year now and GFriend not re-signing their contracts really solidified my concerns. Where HYBE is directly involved they seem to be chasing the international audience, forgetting the thing that makes K-Pop great and why at least I personally listen to it is because it's NOT standard. It's a bit out there and that's the charm. Maybe I'm just being a boomer who doesn't like change but I really believe I'm justified in my suspicions.

a lot of people say they hate the autotune in bts's and txt's music (run away, dynamite, mots7 album) but i absolutely LOVE it. things like shadow and dynamite really have this classic autotune sound. i think this is pretty unpopular because most people i know hate it.

the auto tune they use sounds clean, to some it may sound excessive but to me it's always been enjoyable and has a nice artistic flow. mots7 was heavily criticized for auto tune but mots7 is literally my favorite era from them (one of their CLEANEST and cohesive albums to date) so idk. i also love be and i just prefer their newer music better than their older songs (i do love their old eras too though, but thats a whole different opinion on its own)

unpopularkpopopinions,n94ojz,2021-05-10 15:40:02,The problem with a lot of 4th Gen Kpop music is the lack of melodic choruses.,"Okay, so I'm no expert on music. I'm not sure if melodic is the correct term to use but I couldn't think of anything else. The songs that I'm basing my opinion on are songs like Itzy's Mafia in the morning, NCT Dream's Hot Sauce, NCT 127's Gimme Gimme (I know they aren't a 4th gen group but the song fits the bill), WayV's Kick Back, Ateez's I'm the one (this one strictly doesn't fit the bill but idk I get a similar feeling while listening to all of these songs), and Loona's So what to name a few. These songs all have an instrumental chorus with some sort of talk/rap lines. There's hardly any melody to the actual chorus and the synth's get super annoying after a while. There's nothing to hook you onto the song. I listened to NCT Dream's Hot Sauce today and I couldn't tell you what the song actually sounds like even after 5 listens. Many people said the same about NCT 127's Punch as well but I think that song is different because it has a weird structure and not because of its chorus. The chorus actually has a very distinct and catchy melody.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I wish kpop songs did more melodic chorus because they just have a higher relistening value. You can still do experimental stuff like Don't Call Me or even Simon Says and still have a good, solid melodic chorus. These sparse instrumental choruses are not it.

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of the people suggested that I listen to other groups such as TXT, Enhypen, StayC, Weeekly etc. I assure you that I already do and I really love their music, That's actually how this post came about as I was comparing their songs to other big 4th gen songs. Also, I don't mean to say that instrumental choruses are inherently bad, it's just a personal preference. 

Edit: I meant 4th generation of Kpop in general and not 4th gen groups in particular!

unpopularkpopopinions,n2mm4i,2021-05-01 19:10:21,Ni-ki is my favourite vocalist in Enhypen,"I'm on my way to stan Enhypen and think I already know who my bias is lol. 

Ni-ki is the Maknae of the group and is mainly known for is dancing. Enhypen doesn't have official positions but we all know he's the best dancer of the group and overall one of the best 4th gen dancers currently. So when people talk about him is usually only because of his dancing or facial expressions but not he's vocals which I also understand why. 

I don't know much about vocal technique or anything but i know Ni-ki is probably the weakest vocalist of the group and some people say he has a nasally voice; he's voice may not be that unique but it is definitely special for me. Enhypen has very good vocalists such as Heeseung, Jungwon, Jay, Sunno, etc and like all of them a lot but there's something in Ni-ki's voice that I real love, it's his tone. I absolutely love is speaking and singing tone. 

He has a deep voice and because of that some people want him to rap; he did it when they covered ""Very good"" by BlockB and he did well, so if he wants to rap he has potential for that, but I think it's fine if he only sings. Enhypen songs are not rap based but they are still very good, so if they end introducing rap to their songs I hope it fits. Kinda like TXT, they don't have much rap in their songs, but when they do, it fits and sounds nice. 

Ni-ki's has the least lines in their songs, but he's parts are usually my favourite. 

Given-Taken - I love when he says ""naye bulgeun nunbit"" and his small verse in the middle of the song 

Let me in - I'm so addicted to the part where he says ""I'll give you my lo lo lo love
I'll give you my love"" I swear I replay this part at least 10 times in a row. And of course there's the iconic ""Radi ra ra ra"" 

Drunk-dazen - When the song dropped I wasn't feeling the first verse and the chorus at all however when Ni-ki came in the second verse I started digging it and end up enjoying the rest of the song. Absolutely love the outro with Sunghoon and Ni-ki. 

Fever- This song deserves SOTY btw. He's voice here was everything, all his parts hit hard. And It was nice to hear him singing an actual chorus. 

Mixed up- Here again all his parts hit hard. And he gave us another iconic line ""I won’t stop"" 

I absolutely love his voice and I'm sure with time and experience he will keep improving. He already improved from Iland to their debut and from their debut till now. I can't wait to see him growing as well as the other Enhypen members and their journey as a group!

I don’t keep up with Enhypen but since I see Reddit flooding with positive comments for their new comeback, I decided to check it out. Really enjoyed the song, I looped it for at least 5 times after first listen lmao. It reminded me of Heathens tho, another song that I extremely love. Not only the melody and chords, the monster-ish concept too. Definitely not saying its plagiarism or anything, just pointing out similarities:)

unpopularkpopopinions,n2hrqt,2021-05-01 14:53:26,Blonde hair usually suits idols with tan/darker skin better,"Edit: perhaps I should’ve added this in the title, but I mean to say blonde hair usually suits tan/darker skinned idols better than pale idols. Not that blonde hair suits tan/darker skinned idols better than their own darker hair colour(s), just in case anyone gets mixed up. 

So this is prompted by [an Enhypen Q&amp;amp;A about their recent comeback](https://youtu.be/VHaeBgJ-ps4) where they discuss hair colours that suited the members most. Pretty much all of the group answered Jay and/or NIKI who both have/had blonde hair, but the elephant in the room was that Sunoo currently has blonde hair as well but nobody mentioned him (until Sunghoon realised and said Sunoo too lol).

Now this is of course my opinion but, because Jay and NIKI noticeably both have tan skin/darker skin than Sunoo, who is more on the pale side, I see why the members mentioned them only. To be honest, I’m not a fan of Sunoo’s blonde hair. It definitely looks better than some of I’ve seen, but I think it washes him out, because it doesn’t contrast enough with his skin. This is certainly unpopular on Twitter, most people seemed to love his blonde hair. But I think he looks great with his black hair because of the contrast. Some of the idols I’ve seen who look really good with blonde are Taehyung, Namjoon, Yeonjun of TXT (after the yellow washed out), Jihyo, and Kai, just to name a few. And they all have tan skin. Perhaps this is just confirmation bias, but it’s something I’ve noticed. (Though there are some idols who are paler and have rocked it, imo Yoongi)

unpopularkpopopinions,mywnkt,2021-04-26 14:36:00,Lumepns has lost his touch and BTS need to drop him,"This is mostly unpopular in the ARMY fandom cause lots of people just straight up refuse to talk about this and it might be subjective but I really have been disappointed in Lumpens lately, I find his style to have become extremely repetitive and simplistic contrary to before when I used to consider it more detail-oriented and more focused on camera work and transitions. And my disappointment got confirmed today with Enhypen's new MV(sorry engenes).

His MVs have zero replay value as of late, which is mostly due to him stagnating creatively. His last creative MV was IDOL, despite people not liking the green screen(it's just Camp guys), it was creative and something different at least, IDOL is easily much better than On due to the fact it has more variety, more symbolism and is more dynamic which fits the genre of the song. I don't like MVs where the majority of the MV is basically the same 2 sets being recycled or the same boring color scheme being present throughout the entire video or MVs that don't have a strong culmination point, he used to be much more versatile.

Ever since BTS got big it feels like he takes the lazy routes which are faster rather than more impactful. It might have something to do with the fact that he is now twice as over-worked, considering he is working with other HYBE groups too and he might have burned out, but if that is the case I wish BTS could work with another director. I remember how Yoongi literally said that when he went on set for Daechwita, Lumpens had these simplistic ideas and wanted to keep it minimal and he had to counter this and suggest the historical drama visuals and everything. And Daechwita MV is simply one of the best of 2020, and this is clearly because Yoongi had a creative vision contrary to Lumpens who on his own seems to have run out of ideas for the most part. However, unlike for their solo works where the members have the most freedom and can dictate everything including visual aspects and Yoongi had 4 years to prepare for d-2, I doubt BTS themselves even got enough time to inspect everything about the MV making for each of their group comebacks so the creative execution is mostly in the director's hands.

Now, I am aware that working with another director does not guarantee that the results will be better for sure (e.g. the guy who did Ego should be jailed) but at this point I am so tired of Lumpens I am willing to take the chances and besides, it doesn't have to be someone new, BTS have worked with another director for MDR, Shadow and Not Today and those are one of my most favorite MVs so this is a person who we know for sure has always delivered so far, I just wish BigHit would put Lumpens on hiatus and keep him away from BTS and let BTS work with the guy who did MDR.

Lumpens working on multiple MVs back to back (given how much BH overlaps their groups' releases) literally means at least one of the MVs is gonna get half-assed, and I think BTS don't deserve half-assed shit given that they carry the company on their backs. I'm genuinely praying he didn't work on their next MV, I'm sorry but I waited long enough for him to get it together but it doesn't seem like he is getting over his creative slump any time soon. Like, it's infuriating to me when the music slaps and then comes Lumpens with his boring sets and editing, BTS MV views as of late have all been due to the music and the members themselves and not for the replay value of the MVs cause Lumpens is really not doing anything special anymore.

TL:DR Lumepns has become somewhat lazy and repetitive, his MVs don't have the same replay value as before nor variety, it might be because he is now more overworked but in either case I just think he is going through a big creative slump and I don't want BTS to be on the receiving end of it, basically free BTS from Lumpens and bring back the guy who did MDR and Shadow.

unpopularkpopopinions,ml2xl0,2021-04-06 05:55:22,either txt or enhypen are gonna flop,"I love both groups. I don't stan txt, but I stan enhypen. I have a feeling that one of them will be huge and the other will be left in the shadows. If TXT ends up being bigger than they are now, enhypen will probably be left in the shadows, and vise versa. I would never hope for that to happen, but it's a gut feeling.

I really hope that enhypen go for more of a bad boy concept, while txt has a lighter one. It also the fact that they debuted so close to each other. They both lowkey seem like experiments on who will get really popular like bts did

If one gets huge, I feel like bighit will pull an f(x) on one of them

Edit:

I'm not comparing the groups at all, and I'm pretty sure you can tell that I don't hate either. This is more of a prediction. They just remind me of fx and red velvet because both are so experimental. chill guys, it's really not that deep. hopefully, my prediction doesn't come true, but as enhypen grows, we can really see what will happen to both groups.

unpopularkpopopinions,m5ojbo,2021-03-15 17:27:17,The next trend will be scary and / or magical,"I recently read a post here, saying that the next girl group trend will be ""sad pop"" and  I can't agree with this. It's rather scary / magical, maybe mixed with a bit glitch core, but mostly pretty dark.

The debut of Purple Kiss underpinned a thought I had since Aespa's Black Mamba: The next trend will be a mix of scary, horror, rock and magic. A lot of debuts fall under this mix, such as Enhypen, Pixy, Aespa and now Purple Kiss. 

I think this direction comes from the overload of retro content in 2020. Producers are reading the room, and see that we all are tired of the wishy-washy soft 80's tracks, so they go over to the 90's. You can spot a lot of elements reminicent of that era: goth, black, metal, rock etc.

Maybe I'm wrong and this is just going to be a rookie trend like teen crush or cute, but we see this also rising in late 3rd gen groups: If you scroll though the comment section of Parazona, you'll find the names ""Dreamcatcher"" and ""(G)I-DLE"" immediately. Dreamcatcher has been doing this concept since ""Chase me"", and (G)I-DLE really had this concept with their ""I trust"" mini.

Another factor I see this trend including are really expensive / aesthetic music videos. This is maybe just music videos becoming more and more important, but all of the group's companies I mentioned must've sold everything they had to produce those videos, even smaller companies like Happyface Entertainment. 

I definitely think that TXT, Itzy and a lot of rookie / fourth gen groups will hop (?) on this trend, since it's quite similar to dark teen crush.

unpopularkpopopinions,lip4z7,2021-02-13 01:39:16,"It gets on my nerves when entertainment companies not only debut groups with similar concepts to previous ones they debuted, but with the same member count.","Let me preface this post by saying that I love when entertainment companies experiment with different concepts, markets/ target audiences, and member counts, so when it came to my attention recently that YG will be starting a new girl group, Baemon, with a cute concept, I was very excited....... until I looked it up and it said that there are currently 4 confirmed members, with more *possibly* coming. That didn't sit well with me, for reasons that I will delve into in this post. So Redditors, please bear with me. (This is going to be a loooooong post)

The top 3 kpop groups of this generation are Twice, Blackpink, and BTS. BTS and Twice already have 2 younger labelmate groups of the same gender each; as mentioned above, Blackpink may be getting one soon. Twice's are Itzy and NiziU, and BTS's are Tomorrow x Together and Enhypen. Both BTS and Twice have one younger labelmate group with a different group size than their own (coincidentally both Itzy and TXT have 5 members) as well as a younger *younger* labelmate group with a size the same as their own. 

Why does this matter? Because Twice, BTS, and Blackpink are all 3rd Gen groups. We can all agree that 4th Gen is either here already or is going to come in another 1 year or so. Which means that it is likely a new set of groups will come to power, because that is part of what a generational transition entails. JYP, YG, BigHit, and probably SM too have realized this. 

Interestingly, at the turn of a generation is when you would expect new types of groups to become dominant. But, the fact that the companies of the top 3 groups already have debuted or will debut a group with great similarities to their crown jewel groups clearly disproves that.  

Everyone knows that Twice has a cute concept, and a quick Google search will reveal that NiziU does too. Additionally, while NiziU is under JYP, it's actually a Japanese group and is marketed towards Japan. In this respect, not only is it a lot more like Twice than Itzy is, it is *really* similar to Twice. Twice already had 3 Japanese members and with the debut of NiziU, I can't help but get the feeling that NiziU is supposed to be a Twice 2.0 which is adjusted to be even more of interest to Japanese consumers than Twice already was. Likewise, though BTS's concept is harder to pin down than Twice's, as it is the oldest of the Big 3 groups and probably changed its style the most of 3, it is clear to me (not a BTS expert) that it is a big inspiration to Enhypen. 

Lastly, we come to Blackpink. Though we don't know how similar Baemon's concept is to Blackpink's, there is another ominous example in KPop history. 2ne1, of course. 2ne1 was a 2nd Gen girl group, and it arguably started the girl crush concept. Blackpink was simply known to YG as the prettier version of 2ne1; it had a very similar concept, with just a larger emphasis on visuals. Blackpink took the girl crush concept and released it to the world. (Many groups from other companies have built on it as well). An important thing to note is that both Blackpink and 2ne1 have 4 members.

So. Onto why it annoys me that YG, JYP, and Bighit have decided to take the route of creating a new group with a similar concept and the same number of members at the dawn of the 4th Gen. 

The first reason is the annoyance of it. It annoys me that companies think that repackaging the same ideas in a shinier, newer veneer will attract me or others as a customer. I appreciate groups both because of their concepts and because of their members; however, even if I love the members of NiziU or Enhypen or even Baemon to pieces, that can't overcome the fact that I can tell that these members were put together not to try something new, but to replicate as closely as possible the tried-and-true workings of a previous group. 

The second reason is fear.  I don't fear that Blackpink, Twice, and BTS will be forgotten. They won't. But what I do fear is that it will be normalized for companies to take advantage of our nostalgia for beloved groups and our trust in and appreciation for their concepts. I fear that Kpop will lose its direction and companies will abandon the pursuit of new artistic and musical ideas in favor of giving us content that mimics content that we already loved. Catchy and beautifully executed but familiar and unoriginal songs would become the norm. None of the raw and intriguing power that something new brings to the table. This has already started happening on a comeback-to-comeback level, and I'm afraid of a time when it defines whole groups. 

The third and final reason is that it's simply not as entertaining. As I mentioned at the top, I like when different member numbers and concepts are experimented with. The number of members impacts the formations, member interaction, member roles, and variety content structure. If the new group is from the same company and has the same number of members, it will always remind of the previous group. I don't think that's a good thing; it gives me a sort of ""I've seen this before"" feeling. Also, I think that it can lead someone to subconsciously compare groups, which isn't a good thing either. The younger group may be so similar to the older one that when it fails to deliver the same thrill to old fans, it could be hated on or treated unfairly. Besides, even if the content is just as good, it will only be the second group to have done it, and will never be appreciated as much as the first. 

Finally, the reasons why I think this opinion is unpopular is because people everywhere don't seem to be bothered by the concept similarities; only the personalities and group chemistry matters to them, maybe? They actually seem to enjoy having a younger group with the same concept because they (the fans) consider the members of the younger group to be the little brothers/sisters to the older group; they (the fans) also like to try to find similarities between the members of the older and newer groups and to find hints of the older members in the younger members. People like to make comparisons in general, so this makes sense. Additionally, many fans know that groups don't last infinitely, so they are willing to follow groups that can supply similar content to tide them over.

That is all. This is my first post on Reddit ever, so apologies for being all over the place.

EDIT: It seems that everyone has been pointing out that Enhypen has a very different concept from BTS and is not from the same company per se. I was only partially aware of this, but my point still stands. I did write in this post that the fact that the new group has the same member count as an older, incredibly popular group puts me off as well. Sorry for being vague.

unpopularkpopopinions,kykta1,2021-01-16 16:26:40,Those in the vocal line should use handheld mics whenever possible,"And this applies for all groups. Doesn't matter when you debuted. Doesn't matter if it is 4th gen. If possible, I would  have the main and lead vocalists hold a handheld mic and sing LIVE. They sound clearer, louder and it is much easier to tell when they are singing live. This is one of the reasons why I adored G-friend's earlier stages because the vocal line (Yuju and Eunha) always used handheld mics (but their more recent ones are amazing for very different reasons). 

And they have the vocalist position. There shouldn't really be an excuse. For sub vocalist yeah fine but if you are a lead or main vocalist I really think a handheld should be a used as much as possible.

I think this is unpopular because I've seen many users excuse hard choreography for opting for the non handheld mics but I think the excuse is ridiculous if you think about all those vocalists in groups in the past who have used handhelds and sung well with ridiculously hard choreography. Think of G-friend for example.

But honestly, I doubt this is going to happen anytime soon especially because choreographers these days don't really care about giving a bit more ease for the member who is singing in which line unlike in the past where when a member has to sing their part, the choreography adjusts a bit to make it more manageable. Into the New World's choreo comes to mind. But when you have a choreography like Enhypen's Given-Taken for example, you can't really sing the chorus with a handheld mic without breaking the imagery of the choreography. (which is really unfortunate because I'd rather have Heeseung and Jungwon sing with a Handheld Mic. That would be my dream come true).

But ye. Handheld mic supremacy. I know this isn't realistic but let's just assume we are in a perfect world. Even for a second.

unpopularkpopopinions,kuakyx,2021-01-10 09:14:00,Some groups’ personalities/behaviour seem forced or fake,"
I’ve been a kpop fan as of midway through last year, when I discovered BTS and then other groups and soloists (already established artists as well as upcoming debutees) 
I’m not an extremely versed fan, but I’ve come to notice that *some* artist personalities seem to come across as fake or rather forced and fabricated.

By no means to I believe it is a bad thing for companies to build groups based on not only visuals and talent but also personalities, after all it gives these groups character and something to attract love and attention 

I’ll give some examples to illustrate my point:
I’ll use boy groups under BigHit labels (excluding nuest) to keep a controlled variable. 

Feel Genuine:

BTS: Interactions feel genuine, and is always exciting and watch. Relationships between members are nothing short of adorable and there is a sense of family. 

ENHYPEN: This is a group I’ve been following since I-LAND. The dynamics within the group are balanced, and although they’ve admitted they are still working out their chemistry, the personalities of individual members when interacting are realistic and dynamic 

SEVENTEEN: The group itself is quite large with 13 members but there are natural conflicts and triumphs, that lead to entertainment due to interactions that look natural. Obviously some members are closer than others but there is a sense of family which was built over a long time before debut
Feel Forced:

TXT: the label brothers of BTS are still fairly new in the industry, and although there is some chemistry, I often feel awkward watching their content. Especially Hueningkai for some reason has these outbursts of acting cute that feel like he was asked to do them to live up to the image of an “adorable maknae”. Don’t get me wrong, I love their music and consider myself a fan...... (I also think they deserve better, but that’s an unpopular opinion for another day) sometimes it seems awkward. I’m also slightly concerned that it could be exhausting to have to keep up a consistent persona that is not who you are....

I always thought this is an unpopular opinion seeing as I rarely see comments about this, like fans are scared other fans would disagree or hate them for it. Sometimes love for an idol can also overlook attention to other details....

Maybe you can think of other examples and groups where you have noticed something quite unusual or felt the awkwardness of relationships and behaviour that seems forced. I’d love to hear what you think, this is my first post on reddit since this was something on my mind for a while

EDIT: I came back and found posts for more writing but I cut a lot out thinking that nobody would want to read pages of thoughts (hence limiting it to one label).... looks like ppl want to have more explanation as to why I hold this opinion, so I will be back with more...stay tuned

BigHit is basically the underdog who came from ""nothing"" (og fans remember 8eight) and rose to the top, which is great for them.

But at what point can BHL be classified among the og titans of the industry? There's a lot of discussion, with mainly the BH stans saying Bhl is in a ""league of their own"" (also what revenue says), the Big 3 stans saying legacy is what determines Big3 status and people like me watching from the sidelines (lol)

I think in terms of privilege and connections, it's the Big4. Aespa, TXT, Enhypen are groups that have had enormous predebut support (and a proportionate amount of hate).

But in terms of overall longevity, sheer strength and status, **currently** it's still the Big3. This probably will change in the future, because BHL is debuting nearly 7(!) new groups in the 4th gen alone. These groups will have a lot of fans and this may be weird, but I think nostalgia plays a big part in cementing companies' positions in the industry.

If in the future BHL finds at the very minimum moderate success with all of their new groups, in 10 or 12 years I can definitely see them having a complete dominion over kpop.

However, this is not to say that the other I-Landers should never debut. I just find it strange that the I-Landers who did not make it to Part 2 of I-Land have the potential to reap the same rewards as the winners. I honestly don't think that anyone but the winners should benefit from winning a survival show, but if any eliminated contestant should be absolutely guaranteed a debut, it should've only come from the alumni that were already so close to winning. Otherwise, what's so special about winning a survival show if every eliminated contestant has the same chance of debuting as the winners?

And this is not to supposed to be hate for all possible eliminated contestants to debut, but I also hardly believe that the other eliminated I-Landers beyond the Final 12 suddenly became debut worthy in the span of a few months. I might understand EJ's inclusion, since he was given a major story arc iirc, but that hardly justfies his inclusion. I just think it's a bit unfair to ENHYPEN as winners of I-Land.

I don't know how unpopular this opinion is yet, but I've seen way more people that were ecstatic at the inclusion of EJ, Kyungmin, and Nicholas in Big Hit's Japanese BG rather than disappointed. I feel like this type of opinion may be able to be generally shared among regular survival show watchers, but who's to say for now.

Clearly, I'm not a big fan of what they do with their male group's vocals

But it sounds great with Gfriend their last album was such a treat and Mago was a blast I don't know what they're doing, but Gfriend's vocal editing isn't robotlike and lifeless like TXT's

I really wish Bighit would drop the whole autotuned to shit approach with Txt and tone it down a bit.

I've heard people voicing their dislike towards Bighit's vocal processing but I don't think we discuss Gfriend's vocal editing that much, since they are also from the same company...

I just mean a different song in general to make them stand out. And this is not to say I didn't like Given-Taken either, I just thought a different song could have make them stand out more.

Since ENHYPEN is a 4th gen bg under BigHit Labels, I assumed they would pull a TXT and debut ENHYPEN with a song that would stand out from other 4th gen groups. Regardless of what you believe, you have to admit that dark/hardcore/crush concepts have basically defined the 4th gen, and Given-Taken kinda falls into that category. To be fair, it was pretty obvious that ENHYPEN would most likely fall into this category after hearing most of the original songs from I-Land.

They also could've gone for a more refreshing route and debuted with Let Me In or 10 Months, but that would unfortunately only draw comparisons to their cousin group TXT.

When I first heard Intro : Walk the Line, I assumed that their title track would also sound dream-like or haunting and I was excited that they would be able to stand out in the 4th gen. Though Given-Taken isn't a bad song, it doesn't really differentiate them from a lot of groups.

Even during I-land a lot of fans really loved the song but I don't understand why for this version they made the boys sing with a much higher voice (maybe also added a bit of autotune so that it will blend in with their voices). I can barely recognise who is singing, except for Jungwon since he has a really distinctive tone to his vocals.

The old performances sounded better imo and their voices were also deeper, especially Heeseung's and Jungwon's. I also liked how well Jake blended in with the vibe of the song along with Sunghoon's soft voice.

Since 4 of them sounded completely different in the first one, I still don't get why the new version sounds so high pitched and out of their vocal range.

Now l remember when Bighit released a statement that they were going to debut another boy group (TXT) and everybody assumed that they would be the carbon copy of BTS. 

But turns out that couldn’t have been more wrong. It was shocking when TXT debuted with Crown. It threw a lot of people off.

Big Hit had a lot less experience in managing idol group when BTS debut. When RM joined Big Hit, they didn’t have a proper training system and Bang pd dont even know what to do with RM. They had producers, they had vocal coaches, and they had choreographers but they didn’t have a system. After Big Hit gathered more trainees they hired more staff and professionals and started to learn how to evaluate trainees and develop their own training system so groups after bts will come out more polished.

Even though now Big Hit has a training system it’s still not like the other big 3 companies.

Like on Boss in the Mirror where itzy even training to walk properly like model and have good posture. Or when some big companies even train their trainee in acting, variety show and other sort of training. Im quite suprise that bighit training dont include those training in their system. Heeseung from enhypen talk about this in their vlive that they only train for rap, vocal and dance and extra lesson is like MIDI lesson for producing which Yeonjun mentioned in radio show and songwriting lesson that Heeseung said pdogg (BH’s in house producer) guided the trainees himself.

I actually think Bighit focuses more on training the idols on the performance and music production compared to Big 3 where they focus on entertainment and performance (variety, mc-ing etc.). So their training system might be advanced now too but in a different way.

I still remember Bang PD’s last message to Enhypen which is “See you at the studio.”

Tbh I actually more prefer Big Hit's way of training like about how they guide them to write songs and produced their own music. Idk it's just seem to me it gives more benefits towards their (the artist) careers and they can build on their skills that they themselves probably do not know they have the potential to do so.


Which company’s training system do you perfer and why?

unpopularkpopopinions,k95btl,2020-12-08 15:41:21,10 Months from Enhypen is the best song in their debut album and is one of the best of 2020 K-pop," I'm sure this unpopular. I'm sure of it. There are only a handful of people in youtube, reddit and twitter at least from my worldview who say 10 months is the best song in the Album, much less to say that it is one of 2020's best songs. But for real, it is amazing.

I know most of us aren't a big fan of the vocal processing that BH uses, but for 10 months, it fits right in, similar to how many people are now used to TXT songs sounding very processed because somehow it fits.

Let's get to the song itself. 10 months uses an addictive beat which is one of it's major hooks, but because of subtlety, it may not be the most impactful at first listen. But this driving beat that is paired with the piano intro has set a great tone for the rest of the song, and also helps make it a song that you can listen to it again and again.

The Chorus may not be the flashiest or 'in your face' but it is cute, catchy, and make you bop along to it. The post chorus of 'Love, Love' is not overly repeated and it has such an endearing and satisfying quality that makes you press play.

The feels I get from this song are unexplainable. I can't directly relate with its lyrics (something about a younger boy loving and older woman) because I haven't experienced that myself, but somehow, they way Enhypen delivers this song enables me to hear their desperation and their cute determination to protect the one they like, regardless of age. I also feel the sad undertone that I get from this song. It is really weird. It is so cute, catchy, filled with bright and positive vibes and yet at the same time, when they say 'love', I suddenly feel sad because of the possibility they may be rejected lol. I don't know. I may be too into the song but it is also one of the reasons why I love it so much.

It may not be the first song you like on their album, but it is definitely one of the songs you'll leave liking more and more. And it is still climbing, and it is already among my favorite releases of 2020.

2020 was a complicated year for all of us. There were too many times where our mental health took a hit, me included. I found Enhypen and I-Land in this period, and it helped me get back on the right track. While listening to 10 months, I realized that the way I feel when I hear the song is the same why I feel when a found I-Land and stanned Enhypen. The sad undertone can be attributed to how I would most likely never be able to meet them in real life, but I'll be satisfied being a fan from a far. Consequently, I also feel some special personal attachment to this song (along with Into the I-Land).

10 months is such an amazing Bop. It is one of those songs many over look and think of it as a normal song at first but is a piece which increasingly becomes better and better over each listen. In the span of a week, it is already among my top 10 of 2020 releases.

A perfect 10/10 :)

I know many prefer Given-Taken or Let Me In but I think 10 months is the strongest of the Album. I waited a week to change my mind, but it did not.

unpopularkpopopinions,k55nqe,2020-12-02 09:41:58,ENHYPEN fits boy crush concept better than horror concept.,"It's been only 2 days since ENHYPEN has debuted. I have watched I-Land from the beginning to end. Even though I haven't became fan I was quite excited for their debut. Their debut didn't reach my expectation. But their b-sides are all bops tho. I think their horror concept too much for them. They are only teens right now. Actually their acting in their debut MV quite awkward for me. They seem like lost and have no idea what they are doing. [Let Me In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGFicrydZG0) But in this song they seem like having fun and know what they are doing. Since they are young and still have that bright innocent personality having concept fits their age would do much better I think. But no one cares my opinion and I think it is pretty much unpopular. Also their concept is already planned by Bang PD long ago. But I think they will grow so much in the future. I am excited as well.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Some people have misunderstood me. I don't know what to name this concept. But by 'boy crush' I mean something like IKON's Love Scenario, Astro's Crazy Sexy Cool, Shinee's Hello etc.

unpopularkpopopinions,k7woli,2020-12-06 17:24:59,Groups that just debuted shouldn’t be on award shows,"(Before you get offended this post is about award shows over the years in general and not an attack against enhypen. Yes they were one of the groups I had in mind when writing this, but I also had other groups from previous award shows in mind as well) 

Now when the award season is here I would just like to express my disappointment in all these newborn groups that show up on all these award shows. This isn’t something that’s specific for this year because from what I remember it’s more or less always like this. 

In this post I’m only talking about groups that debuted VERY recently, like within the last 2?months. I won’t give any names but I feel like it’s not very hard to guess what groups I’m talking about. In my opinion these groups haven’t been long enough in the industry to not only attend but to also perform. I mean these groups must have worked on their award performances along with their debut considering how much work there is behind a award show performance. Big powerful companies are basically using these award shows to promote their new group. It just irks me how artists that have done really well this year could’ve performed in their place instead.

These new groups from rich companies will have all the time in the world to appear on award shows for years to come, what’s the goddam hurry? It just really poorly proves how much money talks. The fact that these award shows agrees on these groups to perform without even knowing if the group will have a successful debut or not is so typical. Considering how long it takes to prepare for an award show and how long artists can work on a performance these rookie groups must’ve been working on their performance before they even had debuted.

EDIT; I want to make it clear that I’m not criticizing these groups, they’re are not in the control. I’m talking about the companies and the arrangers of these award shows inviting groups before the group have even debuted, only because their company is powerful.

(lol idk if I can post this here they might take this down too)

For me personally, they didn't really catch my attention except one member. I was considering watching the whole show after watching 1-2 eps but sadly the guy who I really liked was eliminated so I didn't want to watch it anymore. I keep seeing people saying ""they gonna rock the kpop industry"" ""4th gen bgs won't stand a chance in front of them"" and the most annoying one ""the next bts"" (this must be kpoppies favorite line sorry they might make it big but there will never be a next bts) all this when the group hadn't even debuted yet. No hate to them and I am really looking forward for their debut too.

unpopularkpopopinions,iw01j3,2020-09-19 22:21:53,Enhypen is truly just a performance based group.,"As an avid watcher or I-land since the show started, I've come to the conclusion that they were trained to perform well as a group. I am talking about their stage presence and dancing skills here. Sure, singing stably and rapping to beat is important but they never focused their mission on particularly that to establish their particular positions, they never had vocal mentors come to guide them nor did rap instructors come. Rain and Zico in the beginning came and kinda guided them to make them sound as stable as they could but for me it was never about the singing and rapping with this group. Nevertheless, 6/7 now have a dance position and im into that but i still dont know who's gonna sing or rap well. Heesung has a rapper position, im kinda confused lmao. i love them anyway STAN ENHYPEN!

I'm aware that the song is only so long (that is an issue in and of itself), and none of the members got very long to sing, but to give a member no lines whatsoever? Not impressed.

While I know line distribution has never and likely will never be deemed 'fair', case, I think that this specific case is just not it and should not be repeated. Though in saying this I can't help but point out that other HYBE groups have seen fairly 'fair' line distributions, for example &TEAM's Yukiakari was probably the best it could have been split across their nine members taking into consideration the length of those lines.

I hope to be proven wrong, but even if that happens, I will still be disappointed knowing that even if Jungwon is there, his unique voice has been mixed so much it no longer sounds distinct enough for us to know it's him.",8,7

enhypen,1ldc76k,2025-06-17 04:47:15,The face behind some of Enha's lyrics: MBC Anchor Kim Suji,"I just found out today that anchor Kim Suji's side hustle is writing lyrics for kpop groups. 

I was watching J-Hope's episode of Omniscient Interfering View and Kim Suji's segment was in the second half of the episode. They showed a view of her bookcase and it had a signed copy of Orange Blood (among other signed albums from different kpop groups like Illit! ♡).

The handwriting on the Orange Blood album (slide 2) reads: 

>To Kim Suji Anchor-nim, congratulations on becoming anchor for MBC News Desk. \[Thank you\] always for such great lyrics. \[You worked hard/Thank you for your hard work!\] Thank you!!

^((Being promoted from announcer to anchor, and on News Desk no less, is a huge deal. From what I know, it's an extremely coveted position and not an opportunity most announcers can even think of getting throughout the entirety of their careers. That's, of course, just my limited knowledge and I'm willing to be corrected on this.))

The parts in brackets are what I've inferred from context and from what little is legible in the image, so take it with a grain of salt. The ending ""thank you"" was also said a bit cutely / kind of like a cute energetic youth?

Standard: 감사합니다 (gahm-sa-hahb-nee-**da**)  
What's in the image: 감사합니닷!! (gahm-sa-hahb-nee-**daht**)

From my very brief search I've found she's contributed lyrics to Bills, Moonstruck, No Doubt, Loose Korean ver., and Helium. 

For ""Bills,"" her contribution was verse 2, sung by Jungwon and Sunoo. 

Slide 3 is a screenshot of [her post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsijhHzJsuH/) on her main account about her contribution to Bills. She says: 

>Is there a ""good example"" to a breakup? This song is about a person who must pay the price of a breakup after tears and regret find them a little too late after they have parted with their love. No but this song is seriously so good…

She also has verse 1 (sung by Jungwon and Sunghoon) written in the caption of this post, but I don't know whether she wrote those lyrics too or not. 

She now has a separate public ig account dedicated to her works as a lyricist, but she no longer seems to add which specific lyrics she wrote. She seems to be very open about her writing ventures and seems to readily promote this avenue of her work whenever and wherever she can, so I have left the username for her main account visible. 

Are Kim Suji's contributions to Enha's lyrics already known and I just didn't know about it because I'm a newbie? I'm very curious to know. 

I'm also not familiar yet with each member's handwriting, so if anyone can give some insight on who probably wrote on the album as a representative for the group, I'd love to know! My bets are on Jungwon though.",259,18

enhypen,1ldj0mw,2025-06-17 11:50:03,Please stop interacting with non-english speaking fans,"Why do people find it funny or normal to randomly qrt and attack other engenes? In my understanding, a lot of kfans are possessive about Enhypen however whenever they say anything about gatekeeping them, its mostly always a joke. How many times have we seen ifans say stuff like “Oh, he’s just a staff member!” “Oh I can’t believe locals are going to find Enhypen tomorrow its the worst thing ever”??? Aren’t they all jokes? 

Most of these people can’t even read hangul or understand if the person is joking or not. I recently saw another ifan in some kfan’s mentions asking them why they went to Enhypen’s fanmeet instead of voting for them. What does that even mean? Enhypen should’ve just cancelled the fanmeet then so that everyone can stay home and vote. 

Please stop encouraging people from making tweets like these and ratioing kengenes or thai engenes or anyone who’s not tweeting in english because we don’t understand the nuance of the language being used. Jay has atleast 10-15 viral tweets in the past two days and its all on ktwt. How is that happening if fans are gatekeeping them? OP who posted that video is an engene so they should’ve just gone private right? 

There are so many fansign videos coming out these days of foreign engenes saying very impolite and rude things to Enhypen. Its always so difficult for kfans to get into fansigns or concerts because most of them are foreigners. Don’t such jokes make sense in that context? 

I know no side of the fandom is saintly and we all have our own flaws but this sort of resentment is so abnormal and unnecessary. Let’s please mind our business.

All I have to say is the album production and design is INSANE. ",23,3
enhypen,1ldlavb,2025-06-17 14:02:30,Speculation on YOI!!,"#letenharest I mean I really hope they get to rest towards year end but if they don't all we can do is support them:(
Yoi actually reminds me of yoiz xD
I am thinking yoi would be a concept on stars and a special ""force"" that pulls them to ""you"", and it would be a very star-centered concept as seen from the concept film. Really excited because EI (永) means eternal/forever and EN (縁) is fate/destiny so this is stars and eternal destiny:0 Maybe it will be extension to the ongoing lore or a continuation of 結? 
Comment your thoughts!",11,1
enhypen,1ldwkjs,2025-06-17 21:33:45,So proud of ENHYPEN but they need some rest,"Sometimes I forget just how much Enhypen has been through. Their schedules have been packed non-stop since debut, constant comebacks, tours, and barely any breaks in between. It’s clear they’re overworked, and while I admire their dedication, I really hope they get the rest they truly deserve

Now that they’re in their 5th year, it’s amazing to see how far they’ve come: rookie awards, international charting, sold-out tours, brand deals, and steady growth as both a group and individuals. 

Sometimes I wish I had become an Engene during I-Land, just so I could’ve supported them from the very beginning. But even now, I’m proud to be here, cheering them on.

It’s honestly upsetting to see fake or toxic “fans” tearing them down when they’re already under so much pressure, especially over small or harmless things. They need support, not criticism.

Please vote for them whenever you can. They’ve worked so hard — and they should feel just how loved and appreciated they truly are!

I have a bit of a weird request! my friends and I are having a competition on who can make the best edit and I chose to do Ni-Ki there's this one clip I want where im pretty sure its during a live criminal love performance (it's my fav song so I remember watching this specific scene over)
But during his solo the camera zooms in, slows down and changes to black and white i'm also pretty sure he had blonde hair! I know there's one performance where it does the same thing but he has black hair that's not the clip I'm looking for!
I feel like I'm going crazy so if anyone can help me find this that would be so helpful😭🙏

I'm looking into tickets for Amsterdam or some other European stops and noticed that some floor plans don't show runway stage, just the main stage. But considering every kpop concert that ever happened (not even just Enhypen) I don't think it's ever been just the main stage without runway, right? Am I being delusional thinking they just didn't include it in the map? Thank you Engeeenes!

enhypen,1lchore,2025-06-16 04:29:49,A lil' gratitude thread for a surprisingly wholesome era (Desire Unleashed),"Now that promos are finished for Desire: Unleashed, what are some things you're grateful for about this comeback? 


I know not everything was perfect, but it was also a happy time for both Enhypen and Engenes. We shared moments of excitement, celebration, and craziness. It was also fun in our Reddit spaces (shoutout to our mods!). There's a lot to be thankful for 🤗 How about you?


Here are some of the things I'm grateful for:


1. Enhypen competing on Billboard 200 with western artists. Even if we placed 3rd, that's still the best in Kpop 2025.


2. Enhypen competing with 3rd gen since 2024. We don't always win but did Enha ever imagine they'd be putting up a good fight?


3. Jungwon posting on Weverse ""Why is the stage so fun"" ""I'm going to be an idol for the rest of my life""


4. First Ingkigayo win!! 3 music show wins for DU!!


5. Jay's self-composed song Helium


6. The OT7 fairy ending


7. The way their live vocals have been slaying since Coachella


8. Jake and Jungwon mentioning that fans know about their (quiet) personalities and that they're grateful they can be themselves


9. The amazing promos they gave us this comeback from the cinematic film, concept photos, computer game, etc.


10. Jungwon wearing cute angel wings in Too Close



What are you grateful for this comeback? Both big and small things count.",142,24

enhypen,1lcgzii,2025-06-16 03:52:57,Ni-ki deserves so much love and respect,"I’ve been thinking a lot about Ni-ki from Enhypen. He’s been through so much, and I feel like not enough people understand that.

He was only 14 when he debuted. So young in a new country, far from home, with so much pressure on him. It also hurts to know that he was sexualized at such a young age. No one should ever go through that, especially not a child.

Now he’s 19. It feels like he grew up so fast. And even though he’s an adult now, I still see that boy who had to be strong way too early. Still, he never gave up. He keeps working so hard. He dances with so much passion. You can feel his heart in every move.

Because of him, I started dancing too. He made me want to try something new, something that feels free and real. He inspired me to do something for myself.

I really wish I had become an Engene earlier, since debut. I wish I could have supported him from the start. But I’m here now, and I’ll always cheer for him.

Ni-ki is not just a dancer or an idol. He’s a strong, beautiful soul. He deserves all the love in the world.

He deserves so much mire

Please protect him with all it costs

enhypen,1lc97ds,2025-06-15 21:46:54,what do you think about 'enhypen members are being overworked'?,"So I saw 2 videos related to ni-ki

The first [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/EQm6fENMcO8?si=Tq4JOr2NdFlWmpZS) genuinely made me so happy. An engene gifted ni-ki a Kendrick Lamar album and he looked so happy & giggly & excited. I don't know why but it felt like I hadn't seen him smile like that in a while. He probably couldn't keep the gift due to the fansign rules but you could tell he really wanted it.

Right after that I came across another [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/IHk9OUbQO-A?si=fJSkukubeYWqNSdn), I think it was a tiktok with sunoo and ni-ki some other videos were attached too. At least in the first part ni-ki looked kind of tired because usually I can feel the 'main dancer' sorta energy from him during the tiktoks and in second part too he did look tired. Of course it's not right to assume too much from a short video it could just be that he was tired on that particular days but a lot of fans myself included have been feeling like they've been going non-stop lately jumping from one schedule to the next with barely any transition time or break between activities. Maybe I am overthinking too much idk.

If it's the company making those calls, managing these schedules and the members don't have enough say in this then I really hope the boys are given the chance to rest when they need to. But if the boys themselves are choosing to keep going, if they’ve chosen this pace themselves maybe because they love what they do or want to stay connected with the fans then I trust they’re doing what feels right to them. Because I [remember](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFxYx57zbyX/?igsh=MXU4aWkydTd3NTVkZw==) Jungwon once mention that all 7 of them don't like being told what to do that they don't really listen to others, so maybe they're more involved in these decisions than we realize. Still even strongest people need time to recharge no matter how much they love something.

My friend said it's normal for newer groups (still it's been 5 years) to stay busy and I get that. I just hope they're taking care of themselves behind the scenes even when we can't see it because I think there's a limit to pushing yourself and beyond that it's hard to maintain that same spark (coming from a personal experience) and not only this but it might actually end up in something serious like an illness or mental issues.

I came across a clip from an [interview](https://youtube.com/shorts/XYWHsiJpogw?si=LLd_8AbXgB9MBzY8) where enhypen was asked what they wanted to do after their tour they said they just want to go on a trip, eat and sleep together without the cameras constantly recording them. That says a lot. Sometimes it feels like they’re always ""on"" and even their rest becomes content. 

""Enhypen are not children. They have no problem complaining or arguing with the management if they think the issue is serious."" True they’re definitely not kids and can stand up for themselves but we all know how much companies control the idols. Just because they’re handling it well doesn’t mean it’s not exhausting behind the scenes.

Just some thoughts I had. What's your take on this?

Heyy I was listening to the official audio of **""Fatal Trouble""**, and I honestly found it so hard to tell Jay’s and Heeseung’s voices apart, especially during the chorus lol:

**(Heeseung??)**: Fatal trouble, it's getting blurry  
너의 기억이 무너져내려  
**(Jay???)**: Fatal trouble, 널 향한 마음도  
오랜 믿음도 다 coming undone

I don't know you (I don't know you), 난 무너져가 (난 무너져가)  
헤메고 있어 (헤매고 있어), 널 지키게 해줘  
Fatal trouble, 같은 memory  
또 다른 story 날 흔들어놔, fatal trouble

Like… they sound like the *same person* but also not?? 😂 Their falsettos are INSANE though. I can tell the parts switch between them, but it’s still so tricky to differentiate them just by ear.

So far, I feel like Jungwon and Sunghoon are the only ones whose voices I can consistently recognize.

Anyone else struggling with this or is it just me? 👀",5,6

enhypen,1lawhit,2025-06-14 03:16:36,We are so spoilt,"I didn’t find any posts talking about this so I apologise if this is a repetitive topic. 

I used to be a multi and was into other boygroups for a while and coming back to Enhypen was always such a different experience everytime. If someone only follows Enhypen it might be difficult to notice but the amount of content we get from weverse is insane. 

I can’t talk about weverse without mentioning Jungwon. I vaguely remember this one period where he went live almost everyday and I was lowkey worried about him because???? But looking back at it now he’s always been like this since years and it warms my heart so much. I’m sure the company encourages them to interact with fans but I’m also a 100% sure nobody’s forcing him to come online every single day and go live so often. Having a comeback and a comeback show and going live the next day is so unheard of. We all know how intense comeback period is. They don’t get to eat or sleep at all and yet he went live the next day. 

Something that stayed with me is from years ago. I got a notification from weverse which was Jungwon saying that the flight was taking off as they were travelling somewhere. A few hours later I get another notification of him letting us know that they landed and they’re going to the hotel. After they reached the hotel he sent a selca 😭 I remember being so amused by the whole thing like girl my own friends irl wouldn’t update me that much. 

While I’m aware that this might make some fans delusional, I firmly believe that its upto us to draw the line. I always see it as him giving back to fans and because he just genuinely has fun interacting with them. Nothing more than that. It’s still really cute and heart warming. 

The other members as well go live often and join each other freely. A lot of groups don’t do all this and I don’t think anyone should be forced to do so as they do have very busy schedules so everyone needs their down time. I’m also glad that none of these are paywalled as my friend is currently paying for 9 messaging+live subscriptions for a group she ults and thats,, something. ",167,14

When I first actually listened to the album - I was shocked. Most of the songs did not at all sound like what I expected. Here's my opinions! Feel free to comment whatever.

Bad desire: It is probably my favorite song out of the album. I liked it first listen, and loved the choreo. I was surprised when I heard the English version.

Outside: I was shocked by this one the most. It sounds like a rap song (quoted from my brother), and I didn't really like it at first. I listened to it like twice again and... it grew on me per usual.

Flashover: I don't really like this one because it has a... 2016 vibe to it and it doesn't really fit IMO.

Too close: This song literally was stuck in my head for a week. I liked this one first listen as well.

Helium: I was surprised with this one because of the upbeat feel, but it did grow on me quickly. I like this one as well.

Loose: ""I actually didn't know what to think when I first listened. I love it now and even learned the choreo.

OVERALL- I like the album! It has more of a vampire feel than the last album. It gives off a mix of Dark Blood and Romance: Untold. Definitely my favorite album of theirs in the past two years!",5,1
enhypen,1lb3scu,2025-06-14 10:28:37,Enhypen Walk the line in Bangkok- Rajamangala Stadium bag restrictions and wait time before concert,"I am travelling to Bangkok to see the boys from India, and it's my first ever K-pop concert. I am so overwhelmed with the preparations of coming here. I wanted to know if clear bags are compulsory at Rajamangala Stadium or any opaque handbag would work too? I have been reading that Rajamangala Stadium allows normal bags, so carrying a clear one is not necessary, however most of the posts are from like 2-3 years back, so I'm not sure of the relevance. I have cloth tote bags, can I carry them?

Also, how early should I reach the venue, in case I am not able to pick up my tickets from a 7/11.. I have heard the queuing times can get insanely long sometimes. Even if I do pick up the tickets, to enjoy the entire fan experience at the stadium, how early should I aim to reach? I would be staying at a hotel around 20 mins away from the stadium.

enhypen,1la1z4m,2025-06-13 02:04:12,Enhypen lead (main) producer currently is ARMADILLO,">Taking his producer name as a reminder to “move at your own pace and stay grounded,” ARMADILLO stays humbled as **the main producer for ENHYPEN** (*a group he says boasts a versatility that “makes them both fascinating and challenging to produce for""*) after already securing a proven collection of hits for major acts like TWICE, Stray Kids, and Chung Ha.

>I would say that producers at HYBE tend to be deeply involved with the label, from monitoring mixes for upcoming albums to editing and creating tracks for live performances. **Since stepping into the role of lead producer for ENHYPEN, I’ve been devoting 90 percent of my focus to the group — whether it’s album production, concerts, world tours, or year-end award-show performances.**

It's from a new interview of Hybe's producers -- [RollingStone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bts-hybe-producers-pdogg-slow-rabbit-1235356716/)

Enhypen's songs he worked on so far:

1. XO
2. No Doubt
3. Loose Kr Ver.
4. Bad Desire
5. Bad Desire Eng Ver.
6. Flashover
7. Helium",115,32

enhypen,1la26e4,2025-06-13 02:13:22,We need to talk about ENHYPEN’s live vocals on MNET encore.,"i would like to preface by stating that i am an OT7 engene and have been so since i-land; i literally have a fan account, make edits, etc. doing the math, i’ve been an engene for roughly ~5 years.

first of all, i’m SO happy that we won mnet, i did vote and i was so glad we beat svt, every vote really did count going up against a veteran group like that. the boys worked so so hard and i’m so proud of us and them, they really deserved that win after going through so much with rumors and their busy schedule this past year.

however, their vocals at the encore were… questionable. apart from sounding breathless and out of key, it did not sound good as a whole. i will say that heeseung sang very well, but he was mostly the only one in-key for the entirety of the encore despite the whole group not dancing or moving around? if we were a girl group we would most certainly be getting dragged right now.

now, enhypen’s promoting a new japanese single; why are we in such a rush? if this is what we’re getting live, we clearly need to prioritize enhypen’s rest so they can get themselves back. i know that my boys can sing and i think that if they just get some time, they can rejuvenate themselves

thoughts though? open discussion. stream desire:unleash!",0,46
enhypen,1la1lwt,2025-06-13 01:47:02,ENHYPEN: I’m exhausted by this never-ending vampire/dark concept.,"What once felt intriguing and fresh now feels repetitive, forced, and devoid of real substance. The storyline just isn’t working anymore—at least not for me. It’s become stale. The creative box they’ve been placed in is suffocating their potential.

ENHYPEN are incredibly talented, but their artistry feels constrained. I don’t care how others justify it—I’ve simply grown tired of the same recycled aesthetic. The last time this concept truly hit the mark was with X.O. That release had an undeniable x-factor: a strong, catchy title track, a cohesive concept, and a standout discography. Since then, everything has felt bland, uninspired, and forgettable.

No Doubt was a major disappointment. Sure, the music video was visually impressive, but the song itself felt like a chore to get through. And let’s be honest—the past two albums have been musical letdowns. Visuals and cinematography alone can’t carry an era. The music itself needs to evolve, to innovate, to mean something.

I miss the ENHYPEN that took risks, that surprised us, that felt alive. Right now, it all feels like tap water—technically fine, but flavorless and forgettable.",0,10

enhypen,1l7mx2o,2025-06-10 03:55:20,"enha's recent title tracks, while being great songs, don't live up to the quality of their initial releases","i feel like this might be a bit of a controversial/unpopular opinion, but i've been thinking about this a lot today and thought that i could talk about it here, because this is the only space where we can have conversations like these while keeping it respectful.

to start off, i genuinely love every single title track that enha has put out. future perfect and tamed-dashed were the only ones i wasn't super into upon the first listen. i ended up going through an obsessive phase later though, where i was listening to them repeatedly because they were just SO good.

that being said, i do feel like their recent title tracks are lacking the quality of their earlier ones. given-taken is regarded as one of the best debuts by a bg, and drunk-dazed and tamed-dashed received a lot of praise too. enha had established their sound right off the bat. i do think they've managed to maintain it quite well while exploring different genres, becuse otherwise people would have complained that their songs all sound the same, like they do with blackpink. it's very impressive, but it's undeniable to me that their quality has taken a hit.

the songs are short, which is a complaint that i'm starting to find a bit annoying honestly. i can't bring myself to deny its validity though. besides being short, belift is acting like having a bridge in a song is a crime. enha's b-sides used to be safe from such an objectionable decision, but not anymore. that's a topic for another discussion though, since we're only talking about title tracks. 

i also believe their releases are becoming more westernized. this one's kind of understandable because enha doesn't have a super big fanbase in south korea, but at the end of the day, they're still a kpop group. when they kind of veered off course with the release of future perfect, bite me was a step back in the right direction. sweet venom and onwards, though, it seemed belift decided it was more fruitful to try to make enha a bigger name in the west. i think it's time to accept that we're probably never getting that style of title tracks back.

but also, what if belift always planned to keep this style limited to the dimension trilogy? after all, they introduced a very different sound in manifesto: day one. i've heard that they planned to make it a series as well, but because it received more criticism than appreciation, they ditched the idea and made dark blood instead. i would love to hear your opinions, because sometimes other can end up making very reasonable points that you didn't ever consider, and it helps to look at the situation differently.",206,132

enhypen,1l7fy06,2025-06-09 22:43:29,Love for Sunoo,"I can’t believe I hadn’t heard Sunoo’s cover of Beautiful by Crush until now. Goblin was one of the first dramas I ever watched, and Sunoo really captured that same emotion — it genuinely transported me. I also can’t get over how underrated his vocals are.

Beyond singing, his expressions and acting show so much potential, and his recent dance break really pulled everything together. It made me realize again how versatile he is (not saying that idols can only be talented if they can be jack of all trades) 

When I first got into Enhypen, Sunoo was actually one of the members I had a harder time connecting with right away. I kept wondering why — maybe it was the “cute” concept (which I do enjoy, just wasn’t something I latched onto immediately). I didn’t have that moment of “oh, this is him” or “this is what makes Sunoo.. Sunoo” until I watched I-LAND. After that, I really started to get him — but even now, I feel like his talents don’t always get the spotlight they deserve.

Not trying to make this about company mistreatment or anything, but I do think it’s interesting how most members have something very definable about them, while Sunoo tends to get boxed into being the “cute” one (to clarify, definitely not by fans but in how the company wants us to perceive them.)

That recent solo dance break reminded me what it feels to have Sunoo draw our attention to him. I’d really love to see him get a moment that’s just his — a performance or a song that people instantly associate with him.

Edit: I realized my intention might’ve come across differently than I meant 😭😭 I just want to clarify — I don’t think Sunoo is being mistreated, nor is this a call-out against Belift. I stay away from company-related accusations because those are serious, and as a fan, I simply don’t know the internal dynamics or the details of their contracts — so it’s not my place to assume.

This post was really just about appreciating Sunoo (I was hit by a sudden wave of love after seeing his cover 🥹) and sharing a personal thought on how he could be promoted in ways that better showcase his amazing talents. That’s all. ",39,6

When I first hear the previews of the songs I was so surprised, they all sounded so amazing. I've never been so hyped before about a cb. When the songs came out, I was so shocked. I listened to all the songs many times to realize why and here's to what I concluded:

I think that for this album, Enhypen tried out so many different things: theme and concept, type of music, especially for Outside where it's mostly rapping and Flashover where the music is just different, don't know how to explain it exactly. Also I feel like they decided to try out a slightly different way to sing, like the vocals where a bit different, I think they were giving off much more emotion and they were super strong and fascinating, truly remarkable. Also and most importantly, we got Jay for Helium!! It was so good, Enhypen should have more chances to write their songs, they don't disappoint!

So I generally believe that Desire: Unleash is an album where they experimented different aspects of music and it's honestly one of the best albums that came out!",18,4

It seems like they even promote Sunghoon in that way. They don't promote Sunoo in acting way but Sunoo himself and members always talks about his acting & he seems genuinely interested in that. 

I just saw news about member from another group under Hybe debuting as actor & that's just being 2 years or smth since their debut as the group. There's also two another members from the same group already debuted as actors as well. 

I'm not counting Sunghoon's 3min cameo in tv as worthy enough (even tho it shows his and company's intention to promote him more in that route). So why there weren't more? ",3,20

We understand a new album always comes with a lot of excitement, thoughts and opinions so we were a bit more lenient on repetitive posts as long as there was some topic difference/longer thoughts, but it's becoming busy and redundant having multiple discussion posts about the album or a specific song in less than a day.

Please use the existing discussion threads to share your opinions and see what others are thinking:

[Album Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/enhypen/comments/1l3pz1r/desire_unleash_album_info_discussion_thread/) \- also pinned on the subreddit

You can also browse the discussion flair posts to find existing threads for specific songs.

We will ease up on redirecting separate posts in a few days once the existing threads become less active, until then please use the existing megathreads and discussion posts if your topic is the same.

enhypen,1l3rcog,2025-06-05 07:33:24,Lazy appreciation post for Desire Unleash coz I'm overwhelmed in the best way,"This album makes me wish I had one ear for each song coz everytime I listen to a song I think it's the best ever, but then I thought the same for the previous, and will for the next, so I don't know anymore 😭

I thought I was done with Loose, which I did like a lot, but even that seems fresh and new now?! What black magic is this. And don't avoid the Korean version, like I initially did, the vocal delivery and lyrics are different enough that it feels like another absolutely amazing song! 

Right now I'm debating which out of Bad Desire, Helium and Too Close is my favourite, though Outside is ridiculously new and amazing as well, and Flashover is the perfect intro for this album. I think I'll give up trying to rank them in my head, I love them all in different ways. 

Enha really outdid themselves, my expectations were sky high like never before, and they still got exceeded, wtf are these 7 guys and their team

Also I have work, my 9 to 5 literally started with the album release, but I haven't been able to focus a moment and don't think I'll be able to even tomorrow. Please pray I don't get called out 😭😂 I'm grinning like a fool with my headphones on, eyes unfocused on the work screen, my coworkers must def think I'm on something 😭😭

Also I swear I'm more articulate usually but Enha has me STRESSIN, forgive this overwhelmed girl 🥹",60,15

enhypen,1l3qvlf,2025-06-05 07:03:43,A short review - Why Desire : Unleash deserves AOTY,"I'm generally a pretty picky person when it comes to music, and deep down I was afraid that after all the hype (I bought all 10 versions of the album) the songs and music video would disappoint me. I never disliked any of their songs but some of them aren't my style, so I didn't want to have my expectations broken...

Suffice it to say, I was gagged. Floored. Speechless. The music video is so good, the editing is everything I wanted and the concept is beautifully executed. The title track is the right amount of addicting and dramatic, it's doing justice to all of the dark yearning b-sides that never got their accolades.

And the album? Holy shit. They weren't kidding when they said there were many styles they hadn't tried yet. I was skeptical when they said that because the kpop industry isn't exactly known for being very daring with styles, but the moment I heard the Flashover instrumental during the MV premiere countdown I knew they were serious. Like, I never expected a Future Bass track, ever. I was so happy.

All of the other songs surpassed my expectations. From the preview I thought Outside was going to be my least-liked song, and it turned out to be my favorite. I though Too Close wasn't going to be my style, but it's amazing and the drop got me floating. Helium is a beautifully composed song and I got a bit emotional knowing all of the guitar parts were played by Jay himself. Even the English version of Bad Desire surprised me, it sounds very good and carries the same vibe as the Korean version and I don't know which I like more!

I'm not the kind of person that claims everything my favorite artist does is the best in the world just because I like them. I would not say ""Desire : Unleash"" deserves Album of the Year if I really didn't think it was phenomenal. I hope many people find the same, everything about this album, from the concept film to the concept pictures to the music video to the songs have all been amazingly executed, creative, polished, and a demonstration of the true dedication of everyone involved in this album's creation. That's what ""Album of the Year"" means to me. I hope Enhypen get their accolades this time, because they truly, truly deserve it.",44,6

There was no feature on the tracklist, so far the correct answer is: No.

enhypen,1l2cff7,2025-06-03 15:50:41,Will Bad Desire and/or any b-side of D: U have any collaboration this time??? Just like their past releases.,"In OB, we had sweet venom with Bella Poarch. With R: U, we had XO with JVKE, both producing and collaborating with them, as well as BTHB and Ava Max. Will it continue with D: U Bad Desire, along with a b-side, having a collab this time??? If yes, which b-side will it be???

LSFRM had a collab with Little Mix fame JADE with HOT, and Come Over was produced by British band JUNGLE. What will be for Enhypen???

Many are expecting Chase Atlantic to date, given that Bad Desire sounds similar to their DB concepts, and the duration of the TT is short. Will we get an Extended edition/Extended release this time???

Even if in case, Enhypen x Chase Atlantic becomes possible, will we be getting a collab for a b-side like BTHB, with any solo singers like Shawn Mendes, Charlie Puth, Benson Boone or a female solo singer, etc.... or an alt-music band like LSFRM x JUNGLE.

I know kpopusaonline has pretty good shipping, but the only pob they offer is the Apple Music pob (I prefer the Weverse ones). I found kplace. They have free shipping if you spend $119 and they offer Weverse pob. The only concern is they start shipping them after 7/7😅.

enhypen,1kzosbf,2025-05-31 06:46:54,Enhypen‘s popularity and achievements needs to be talked about…they’re just an all rounder group!!,"It’s been 5 years since enhypen have debuted and honestly their popularity have skyrocketed especially since they’ve had many hit songs like fever, Polaroid love and Bite me which have accumulated a bunch of streams and honestly they’re one of the best boy groups after BTS. Don’t even get me started on the line up, I’ve watched I-land and when I tell you that this line up really was fate like all the members really shine in their own way. Their visuals are also out of this world! How are all the members so handsome!! Enhypen just have it all…they’re vocally talented, they all dance and match each other’s energy, you’ll never get bored watching their performanced. And the lore?? The whole vampire concept is so sexy and fits their image so well. Lastly, their music style is also very different. They don’t stick to one single genre and I think that’s what make enhypen so listenable. From listening to their debut song, Given-taken to Bite Me and XO (only if you say yes), enhypen aren’t afraid to explore different styles and bring out the best music to their fans. I’ve listened to multiple bgs like seventeen, txt and stray kids but aside from BTS, enhypen are the second ones that have captured my interest. Their discography is talk for another day but I’ll just say they have no skips. No other groups are on Enhypen’s level and their achievements as a 5 year old group just proves how successful they’ve become and will continue to do so. 
Just this year,
- Enhypen have ranked #2 on the IFPI global album sales Chart after Taylor swift 
- Performed at Coachella showing off their amazing stage presence. 
-ENHYPEN also becomes the fastest K-pop Boygroup to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify.
-ENHYPEN will hold a stadium concert in japan twice this summer, makes them the YOUNGEST and FASTEST kpop act to hold stadium concerts in japan just in 4 years of their career.
These are just few of the achievements they’ve achieved so far and more is coming soon! 

🌟Their new album DESIRE: UNLEASH is dropping on June 5, 2025 with Bad desire ( With or Without You) as the leading title track and it’s about to become one of their biggest hits in their careers. I hope new fans can discover how amazing this group is.

I wouldn't call myself an ENGENE because I don't follow them, I purely like their songs and choreographies, pretty much.

I got into Enhypen a few months ago and can't wait for desire unleashed. I already have a romance: untold album and plan to get one of desire: unleashed, but looking at the store confuses me. I see MAKE ver, YOU ver, MINE ver, and ENGENE. 

I understand the album isn't out yet, so do we not know what the difference is? Is it like the different versions of romance: untold with different photo cards, photo books, etc? 

Also, what's with the Engene version? I've seen other albums have the engene version and it ends up being exclusively about one member if I'm not mistaken? Do you get to pick which member you get? Am I completely off??

Thanks!",8,3

enhypen,1kw5c3s,2025-05-26 22:57:15,Comparing each member’s voice to a food/drink!,"I am brand new Engene and I have been listening to all their albums and songs. At first, I found it very difficult to distinguish their voices but now I tell them apart easily. Here is a little comparison of what I think each member’s voice sounds like to me. I am by no means an expert but I thought it would be fun! 

1. Heeseung: Hot Honey 
He has one of the most beautiful voices ever. So smooth and rich and beautiful and the best part is is that it’s not just technically great but it has so much life. It moves and there is a real sense of play in it, which is why I chose hot honey. It’s not just sweet and one note but so dynamic as well. 

2. Jay: Cherry Liqueur 
Jay, my bias, sounds sweet and sharp to me but there is an extra element in there that gives it something special. There is something very seductive about his voice that makes all his yearning/whispering songs really pop. His was actually the voice that took me the longest to distinguish but when I did, I could really lock in.

3. Jungwon: Mint 
Someone said this on a sub that Jungwon’s voice is super fresh like mint and I completely agree. His voice always stands out to me and it was the easiest to recognise. It sounds like a minty breeze haha or being in the mountains surrounded by pine trees. I love his voice so much! 

4. Jake: Semi-sweet Chocolate 
I picked semi-sweet chocolate for Jake because his voice sounds not too saccharine and full-bodied and addictive. There is a bit more depth and rasp there and it’s really satisfying to hear, especially in songs like Bills. 

5. Sunoo: Matcha
Sunoo’s voice also has that lovely earthiness that Jungwon’s voice has but it’s sweeter sounding to me. It’s also bright like matcha! I imagine Sunoo’s voice like a lovely matcha latte that is refreshing and sweet but also earthy and whole. 

6. Niki: Ice (in a whiskey glass) 
Bear with me but Niki’s voice feels like a cool, silvery cube of ice floating in aged whiskey. It just hits the spot. I always reply Ni-ki’s parts and they always feel a little grungy and dark. It tickles a very specific part of my brain and I genuinely cannot get enough. 

7. Sunghoon: Charred Sweet Potato 
This is super specific but Sunghoon sounds exactly like charred sweet potato to me. His voice is very manly and hearty but there is a smoothness and creaminess to it. It really comes through when he sings high notes. So delightful and yummy! ",51,10

We had a quick poll about what banner we should use for this era, and we had some responders wanting to submit a custom banner design, so we are turning this rebrand to a small event and opening a banner submission form, and we'll put up the icon for contest as well.

**You can submit a Desire : Unleash themed banner design** [**here**](https://forms.gle/UHxkFKYsHTCqevbd9) **until May 30th 12 AM KST.**

Ideal banner size would be 1920 x 240 px for desktop and 1600 x 480 for mobile. Please center the important image/text on the banner as the sides tend to get cut by reddit especially if you don't create a separate mobile banner.

*AI edits, non-original fanart usage not allowed. Banner should either be ot7 or no member photos featured.*

The submitted designs will be posted for a round of vote along with the winner of the first poll:

https://preview.redd.it/fw723i29063f1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daaeaf7582d8171c6b938de05f8f1c1b6e4d0861

I love romance untold and listen to the album on repeat but the new album and its aesthetic is sooo sooo good plus rn if i order ill also be getting the pre order gifts.

what im really confused about is that is Desire unleashed not going to come in a box?? like looking at the pics on weverse shop i can’t make out what the outer packaging is gonna be 
like. 

another important thing is that R:U is a full length album whereas D:U is a mini album

plus in either of the albums i wont have a choice which one im gonna get because weverse sells randomly.

please help me out 😭",6,2

The title track “Bad Desire (With or Without You)” stands out as the highlight. Set to a sleek dance-pop beat, the song embodies an intense yearning to “turn you into a vampire,” exuding ENHYPEN’s signature urban and seductive charm. 
Paradoxical lyrics such as “Heaven without you is hell,” and “Hell with you in my arms is heaven,” portray a longing to be together forever, even if it means breaking taboos.


ㅡ Flashover: an electronic future bass genre with an impressive dreamy sound

""Flashover"" is an electronic future bass track defined by its dreamy sound. The intense lyrics, describing desire that blazes like fire, are complemented by a stylish beat that captivates the listener.

ㅡ Helium: dynamic pop rock genre

“Helium,” produced by JAY, is a thrilling pop-rock track filled with an adrenaline-pumping tempo. The members’ unrestrained vocals and driving beats evoke the feeling of racing toward someone, making hearts race.


ㅡ Too Close: a pop genre that stands out with its lyrical and romantic

""Too Close"" is a lyrical and romantic pop track that captures the electrifying sensation of being so close to someone that even rational thought seems to disappear

ㅡ Outside: a hip-hop trap song that maximizes charisma with its heavy bass line and powerful beat

""Outside"" is a hip-hop track which intensifies charisma with a heavy bass line and powerful beat that talks about changing someone like oneself

Edit : found descriptions for Outside

I was hoping that desire:unleash would take a turn in the same direction but doesnt seem like it. Did fans not like dark blood much because of which hybe is afraid to take the same risk as they did back then?

If you did in the past:
1. What made you change your mind? 

If you do now:
1. Could you have reasons why they might become one? 

Personally, seeing the debut line-up made me feel threatened in some way (considering that I was stanning a Big Boy group)
Saw how Drunk-dazed and fever became Tiktok hits followed by polaroid love and all of these songs that I heard casually are all excellent in my taste. Their voices and visual is also a big, big plus. They're so cohesive, harmonious that they look like they're meant to be together. Enhypen is my awakening in talent preferences. It feels like they just need that one final push in order to dominate, though I also feel that even if their growth is slow and steady, they will arrive in the top spot regardless of their pace. Additionally, their growth in terms of skills and mindset are steady and mentality is also very strong, they can carry big hate thrown upon them, survived despite having multiple controversies. Punching bag of KPOP stans nowadays, and last, they're slowly being appreciated and known in Korea after Coachella (hope they could get ARTIST OF THE YEAR AWARD this year because they proved themselves in Coachella and also shifted how some locals and old KPOP stans that there are still skilled and talented KPOP artists)

Summary:
1. Great discography 
2. Members strong mentality
3. Survived despite multiple controversies
4. Growing Popularity
5. Steady growth in terms of skills and talent
6. Visual and vocal appeal and chemistry
7. Personality appeal and chemistry
8. Genre versatility
9. Skilled foreign communication skills
10. Ambitious and competitive
11. Authenticity in Variety shows and fan-services",104,49

enhypen,1krcldw,2025-05-20 20:39:32,Question about DESIRE : UNLEASH (ENGENE Ver.),"I bought the set of 3 versions during preorder (Make, You, and Mine), but after seeing the ENGENE version pictures I want to get it as well. But looking at the WEVERSE shop website, I see ENGENE version has a Set and Random versions. The Set version says it comes with 7 albums? I'm confused. Is ENGENE version one for each member? Does this ""set"" also come with the Make, You and Mine versions? This is only my second time buying a kpop album, and I've never bought an ENGENE version (last time I bought Romance : Untold \~ daydream\~). I'd appreciate if anyone knew how it works lol",14,4

enhypen,1kqt7e8,2025-05-20 03:44:20,"Planning to buy an album, tempted to buy the whole set.","This is my first comeback with Enhypen and I always commemorate my first comeback by buying an album of the new release. *(Technically, I already bought the engene version of R:U because my niece and my cousin are fans and I gifted them--us--I bought some for me too--some Enha stuff, but it doesn't count because I just got excited lol).*

My question is... what is the difference between regular POB and weverse POB? What are the specific items? 

I don't plan on going to fansigns any time soon. I don't really know how it works and I don't plan to blow away a lot of money for a few minutes of interactions with the members. 

Considering all of this, should I just go for the regular POB? I also can't choose which version I want so I might end up buying the whole set \*cries in broke\*. Can you try convincing me to just buy one? And which version should I buy?",24,21

I know that some kpop idols like Jin enlisted at 30 and the rest of BTS had their military service deferred for a while. Do yg think enha would have the same deferring chance?? I keep hearing that they wont end up renewing their conctract due to hybe and belift beef going on but i highly suspect of thats even true. . Also would jake and jay have to go???

 The regular album cost me $42 so if I get a signed album, I would spend $115 for two albums (it is kind of a lot).

I was wondering if I should just buy the signed version later or would the prices go up? Should I get it now by paying through an installment plan idk what to do ",4,5

enhypen,1kq3k16,2025-05-19 06:59:28,Heeseung rant 2.0,"I'm back with another one hehe

So it's been what, almost 6 months getting to know enhypen and I've just been falling more and more for heeseung especially. 

I'm shocked and amazed to find out that he was 18 when he was in i-land and that gave me a whole new perspective on him. 

Because you're telling me that he was competing like crazy and being that mature at 18?? One thing that caught my attention, that I don't think people really talk about, was the fact he knew he would potentially be a target of other's jealousy because of his skills (keep in mind I'm not targeting enhypen here, they're all pookies to me) with him saying ""I knew this would happen, that's why I didn't raise my hand for the first part""

He was hesitant to opt for the 1st part in the very first i-land test because he knew that if he raised his hand, people will pin him as this arrogant person when they all knew that he was the best person for that part.

Then onto the part where he even cried for the eliminated participants who painted him as the bad guy!!! This always shocks me cause that's a BIG heart.

I'm so glad that he's the eldest in enhypen cause imagine someone who's not like him be the oldest for a group who JUST got out of competing with each other.

It's honestly commendable that heeseung kept the synergy for enhypen lively and friendly, being his silly, goofy self and making others comfortable, looking out for them and just influencing the younger members positively! 

I love him sm 🫶 may he get more opportunities in the future lessgooo

I wanted to ask which version of the mini album everyone is getting? I don't actually buy albums often, both for monetary and not-much-space reasons, but the teasers released so far definitely made me want to pre-order it.

I'm torn between getting MAKE ver (ahem👀) and Engene version (if I can't get all versions, I wanted to at least have Jay's pics).

**First song: Drunk-Dazed**  
I discovered it on Spotify, I had this random playlist on. Then it started playing and i was like, ""Yoo this is intense, i need to hear more of this!""

**First fav song:** **Given-takn**

I was OBSESSED, yall can understand why. Heeseung's vocals, they're movements! I was drunk to it.

**Current fav song: Lucifer, Fever, Bite Me**

I don't know why but i CAN'T stop listening to Lucifer. O2z outshone themselves on this one fr.   
Fever is that one of those songs i can play on road trips and my parents won't be able to know what the lyrics mean. Even they jam singing ""Like a fever fever fever FEVER!"" I am addicted to Jake's Fancams. Jake and Ni-ki's Chorus? Chefs kiss.  
Bite me is goated and will always be goated. We lost the original choreography 'cuz of some toxic ENGENES. shame on you. But like, HAVE YALL SEEN THOSE HEESEUNG, JAKE, NI-KI AND JUNGWON FACECAMS?

**First Bias: Heeseung and Jay**

**5yearz** caught my eye first when i saw a Drunk-Dazed performance. Heeseung and Jay's raw vocals are saurr scrumptious i was obsessed!

**Current Bias: OT7**

like, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSSED TO CHOOSE A BIAS FROM A PERFECT GROUP BRUH? over the years, as i learned about them more, it became hard to focus just on my bias. so i was like, ""I'll just be OT7, this way i won't feel guilty for simping for someone other than my bias"" :)))",29,34

Any one of the  make/you/mine version contains a cd, cover, photobook, seal set, poster, sticker, 2 photocards, 7 mini photo piece, 2 photocards.


engene version contains a poster, booklet, cd, sticker set, poster, 2 photocards, 1 character card

i would obv prefer the make/you/mine version but i think the cover is made up of paper which will be difficult to keep safe and the price difference for me is also quite a bit.

please suggest",13,11

enhypen,1knnky3,2025-05-16 02:18:31,What are some impressive Enhypen achievements or charts?,"As a data nerd, I wanted to talk about some milestones we don't really discuss outside Entwt spaces. Some of these are crazy and really impressive.

Here are some things I’ve seen but add some more:

- Romance Untold is the 3rd most sold K-pop album this year—even though it only came out in July 2024.

- Romance Untold peaked at No. 17 on Circle Chart, which is the highest peak for any ENHYPEN album to date.

- They’re the fastest K-pop boy group to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify.

- Currently the second 4th-gen boy group with the most monthly audience on YouTube Music.

- They’ve consistently been in the Top 3 most streamed K-pop groups (including both boy and girl groups) in the last 24 hours for months, averaging 4.5M–4.7M daily listeners.

- Top 2 in Weverse Community Memberships with 11.4M members.

- No. 1 artist on TikTok Korea, and No. 2 globally in 2024.

- Top 3 boy group with the most monthly listeners on Spotify (currently at 8.5M).

- Heeseung has surpassed 5.3 billion views on Douyin, making him the most viewed 4th-gen male idol.

- Heeseung also ranked No. 1 on the WeChat index for several weeks, beating out local Chinese celebrities. ENHYPEN as a group ranked No. 17, and they’re the only K-pop group on the list.


I haven't even begun to check other individual members' milestones or their touring data or views. They seem to be solidly in 3rd place in boy groups after BTS and SKZ, sometimes surpassing girl groups as well.


What are other cool achievements they've reached?

#ENHYPEN

###The ‘DESIRE : UNLEASH’ Concept Cinema is ENHYPEN’s second challenge in acting. Compared to the previous film, what has changed and are there any parts where you felt you grew?

**HEESEUNG** If we had many lines in the previous film, this time we had to express emotions through our facial expressions. That was the biggest difference.

**JAY** I think my acting improved considerably. (Laughs) I felt I was lacking in the previous film. This time, I took reference from Tom Ellis in the American drama ‘Lucifer’, and because of that, I became better.

###I’m curious about the other members’ thoughts, too. Whose acting especially stood out in this film?

**JUNGWON** Jay! I felt like he really acted well this time.

**HEESEUNG** Jay and Jake did the best at expressing emotions. 

**JAY** I will choose myself as well. (Laughs)

###From the behind-the-scenes video, the atmosphere at the filming site looked great. Were there any particular memorable moments?

**JUNGWON** Spending time with the director. (Laughs) We had similar humour, so I was able to enjoy filming. When filming the scene where Sunghoon and I made our first appearance, we kept bursting into laughter, so there were many NG cuts. That was memorable too.

**HEESEUNG** For me, watching the completed video with the members was memorable. We filmed a lot of scenes separately so I was looking forward to seeing how it would come together. The film ended up being very cool so I was touched.

**SUNGHOON** The most memorable moment was when Jungwon and I filmed the introduction scene at the very end. I felt the pressure because it was going to be the opening scene in the film, but the scene came out well. This scene was also the last one we filmed so I had mixed feelings about the filming ending.

###While talking about the characters in the Concept Cinema, I became curious about how similar they are to the real-life ENHYPEN members. If you compare yourself with your character in the Concept Cinema, which parts are the same and which parts are different?

**JUNGWON** I have actually always thought vampires and humans are similar. Humans are also beings who follow their instincts and live while satiating their desires. In those ways, I think they are similar. But within the film, my character is someone who only follows his instinct, which is different from who I am in reality.

**JAY** My character in the film is overflowing with confidence. In that sense, we are fairly similar. But compared to me, the character is more imposing and brazen, so that’s where our differences lie. Should I say he’s a version of me who has more confidence?

**NI-KI** Heeseung and I were in charge of two characters in one, and I was the character who had more of a corrupted nature. That kind of mood suits my everyday image. However, the character in the film has a lot of fears whereas I don’t, so that’s the difference between us.

###What’s one scene that ENGENEs have to watch?

**JAY** Compared to the previous film, you will be able to see how I have evolved, so please take a close look at all of the scenes.

**JAKE** Rather than one scene, please pay attention to our facial expression acting that connects with the mood of each scene.

**SUNOO** The elevator scene! I personally really like the scene, but there are some parts I’m not satisfied with so if given the chance, I want to give it a try again.

###Your 6th mini album ‘DESIRE : UNLEASH’ is set to be released on June 5th. What kind of album is it and what can fans look forward to?

**JAKE** Compared to previous albums, the songs are more diverse in genre and mood. You’ll be able to meet an ENHYPEN with various sides.

**NI-KI** The album is centred around the keyword ‘desire’. If you listen to all of the songs, you’ll be able to thoroughly experience the narrative. I wish time would go faster so that ENGENEs could quickly listen to all the songs.

###The album’s title ‘Unleash’ means for emotions or energy to burst or explode. What was the latest experience you’ve had related to ‘explosion’?

**HEESEUNG, SUNGHOON, SUNOO** Coachella! It was a moment where we were overwhelmed with happiness. It was a performance where we showed everything we had prepared. It was very fun and if we get another chance we’d love to go to Coachella again.

###What are your personal ‘DESIRE’s?

**NI-KI** Our comeback is approaching, so I want our album activities to finish well and for us to show a good appearance to ENGENEs as soon as possible.

**SUNOO** I want to spend one month reflecting on myself in a relaxed manner. Up until this point, I only ran while looking at what’s in front of me, but now I think I need time to think slowly and reflect on myself. I’ll also take a rest simultaneously.

###Just like SUNOO said, it seems like you live day-to-day with no rest. From Coachella to preparations for your 6th mini album comeback, ENHYPEN kept running restlessly. If you had a one-month break, what would you like to do the most?

**JUNGWON** When we were given free time in the past, there were many occasions where I didn’t know how to spend it so time just ended up passing by. That’s why if we get a break, I’ll try to break it down week by week and create a schedule, go travelling, and go to good restaurants.

**JAKE** I want to go to Australia, where I was raised. I couldn’t go often after debuting, and I also want to see my friends after a long time.

**SUNGHOON** There are many things I want to do. If I had to choose two things, I would go on a healing trip with my family, and I would try to do the things I’ve always wanted to do.

###Finally, what do you want to say to fans who are waiting for the upcoming album?

**ALL MEMBERS** Through this Concept Cinema we were able to meet you up close after a while, so the comeback feels more real. We can’t believe it’s already the 6th mini album we’re releasing—time really passes by quickly. Many people must be looking forward to it given that we’re coming back with a vampire concept. To live up to that expectation, we are preparing hard, so please wait for us.

In June’s hot summer, let’s create good memories and have fun with our activities together, ENGENEs!

#PARK MINSOO DIRECTOR

[Skipping over non-ENHYPEN-related questions]

###You typically shoot documentaries. If you were to film a documentary with ENHYPEN, what would you put into it?

I think it would be good to film a mockumentary using this vampire concept. Adding in comedic elements, it would be a way to show the fun points in the members’ daily lives. After meeting the members in person, their characters are very apparent. I think I could make an interesting piece of work if those characters were brought to life and shown clearly.

###What kind of characters came to mind?

For example, Ni-ki and Heeseung are quiet and calm. Jungwon and Sunoo are more playful and full of mirth? As for Jay and Jake, it would be cool if we could show them naturally speaking English. Sunghoon, in any case… shouldn’t he play the role of a handsome vampire? (Laughs)

###Were there any memorable episodes during filming?

There’s a funny episode with Sunghoon that came to mind. It didn’t make it into the final cut, but there was supposed to be a part where Sunghoon turned around and light would come from his face using CG. We had to stick dots on his face for CG, so when filming ended, the assistant director said, “Please remove the dots on his face now.” Sunghoon replied, “Oh, these are my dots [referring to his moles].” I thought to myself, ‘Ah, even his natural moles are perfect…’ (Laughs)

#SPECIAL TALK

From deep stories to mischievous questions, ENHYPEN directly interviewed the director themselves.
###SUNOO: Do you normally like vampire-related media?
Yes, I do. Works like ‘Interview with the Vampire’ and ‘Twilight’. While preparing for this project, I took reference from ‘Interview with the Vampire’ in particular. The core of a vampire story is always the conflict between its humanity and monstrosity. I wanted to incorporate those emotions into this.
###SUNGHOON: How did you decide the roles of each member?
When watching videos of all the members, I realised it would be nice if we could show each member’s personality and image naturally. I decided each character based on how the members usually are.
###JUNGWON: Amongst the members, who was the best at acting?
Actually, everyone did well. Everyone has plenty of experience on the stage, so their expressing emotions was natural. Still, if I had to choose, it would be Ni-ki and Jay. Ni-ki’s concentration when it comes to acting left an impression on me, and the tone of his voice was intense. As for Jay, he did very well with strength control when delivering his lines.
###JAKE, JUNGWON, NI-KI: The appearance of the monster was impressive. Were you inspired by anything?
It started from a bat. Vampires are frequently associated with bats. I designed the monster while thinking of bright eyes and dark-coloured elements, and of the image of a monster that is likely to come out in a 70s-80s American TV show. “How would I show a monster from that era?” is what I was thinking. 
###JAY: In the final scene, what was the meaning of the monster’s hand twitching?
It means he came back to life as a vampire. If you’re bitten by a vampire, you’ll become a vampire. I wanted to put that symbolic turning as the ending.
###HEESEUNG: What do you think is the most important element of shooting films?
The characters. No matter how amazingly you film or how cool the locations are, what pulls the story along in the end is people themselves. The characters’ feelings, states, and attitudes are the most important elements. I film with that as the foundation.",40,3

enhypen,1klcjp2,2025-05-13 05:53:18,What's the first Enhypen song you've heard way before you became a stan?,"For me, it's ***Home.***

  
I haven't checked any content related to this song so idk if it's a side quest or just a project specific to a time/era or something else.

Home is actually (if I remember correctly) the very first Enhypen song that I've heard. I didn't know them at the time. I think it was just last year. I've heard of the group here and there but I already had an ult group (Seventeen) so I didn't care about any other group.

I heard Home randomly one day and I thought it sounded different from the other KPOP songs I've heard. I dont' know. There's just something about it that seemed new to me. Fresh to my ears. I didn't even love it that much but it was interesting.

I wouldn't seek this particular song out to listen to it. I'm not really a fan of this song, I mean compared to their other songs, but I always feel nostalgic whenever I hear it (it's not even that long ago haha).

Can you remember the first song you heard from Enhypen before you even checked them out? What was your first impression of the song and of Enhypen? And if you were to rank that particular song along with their other songs, where would you place it?",34,62

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/hao625705e0f1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1c1f54e04caa5b0659746caf54a95298af0bafe)

Moving on to SUNGHOON, SUNOO, and JUNGWON.

We start with a **medium master shot** of SUNOO entering the elevator (or lift, for the European ENGENEs).

A medium shot frames the subject, in this case SUNOO, from the waist up. Park Minsu placed this shot at a **high angle**, meaning the camera points down on the subject. I only employ high angles when I want to make the subject seem smaller or powerless. It seems that Minsu may have wanted to shoot at this angle to expose more of the environment, or to perhaps give the audience a somewhat voyeuristic view.

He also **pedestals down**. As opposed to the tilt, a pedestal moves directly up and down on a vertical axis, while a tilt actually rotates the camera, often on a ball head using a tripod. We use this camera movement to emphasize scale or track movement from the subject and environment. In this case, the pedestal captures the elevator doors sliding open and SUNOO entering.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/vlvl1fot7e0f1.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfe2f79b58a74c230b7b8ebe87e7bbb1a5ba3f1)

We see the same movement in the close-up of the buttons. From what I understand, watching the SUNSUNWON sequence in its entirety, only vampires can see and use this button—a rather ominous icon of a tower. EDIT: More observant ENGENEs corrected my mistake—not a tower, but an upside-down bat. 

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/s1w5aror8e0f1.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cdd46b2f4b9e9f4d04000d155c479606ccf6f3d)

We get a **wide shot**—not just to show off the cool and captivating presence of SUNOO, of course—but to set up the moment when a hand reaches out, preventing him from riding the elevator alone and uninterrupted. This concept has suggested brooding, angsty, and human-averse vampires. SUNOO sees the couple and reacts with disgust—or perhaps *alienation*. We could see this as an allegory for the marginalized experience: SUNOO, a vampire, trapped in a confined space with two humans immersed in their own desire (emphasized by the hand-holding), who then turn and laugh at him.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/uckpawdxae0f1.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fb530e33eca2f1caacac05f0a89ec88cff54952)

His next look could be one of longing—wishing he could have, or be, something he cannot (whether his heart aches for love or humanity, we can view these themes as two sides of the same coin, not mutually exclusive). Or, judging by his eyeline, perhaps we catch him staring *at her neck*, at the crook between her shoulder and cheek. We witness a different kind of desire simmering beneath his cool exterior.

*Hunger*.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/kahszzrzce0f1.png?width=1133&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c1980b2f5e1b01973e99fc070cb5b0f7d9e750)

And what do brooding vampires do when they can't have something?

*They destroy it*.

Wait a minute—isn’t that the theme of the entire film?

What a coincidence. 😉

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/063i76emfe0f1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d7538f7ee1525c12978f60c40d5a706737f67a9)

I wonder why SUNOO chose to bite her wrist instead of her neck. It could be as simple as Park Minsu letting the audience know that vampires can feed on humans through any ""entry point."" To avoid the redundant neck bite. Or even to weave in deeper themes of sexuality. I do find it an odd choice to bite her wrist considering the previous shot of him *blatantly* staring, or at least trying not to.

I wonder if SUNOO, the notoriously soft-hearted brother of the bunch, both in concept and in reality, decided to spare her of the brutality of the neck bite, or even had his own memories of SOOHA/CHLOE that clouded his perception of biting another woman.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/gmynlwrwfe0f1.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a353027a4860d8b5e072378fa42f9ded58ae98f)

From a cinematography perspective, I *love* this shot! We have a woman on the far end of the wall, near JUNGWON, as well as a man and a woman walking out of the club in similar gothic fashion. We could deduce that the wardrobe department wanted to separate the humans from the vampires using fashion and iconography.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/0zbh4wpche0f1.png?width=1137&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d6740fde41ad64550d92263152675eefd21ab3d)

We can confirm this theory in the next two shots. A bouncer holds up a tarot card. JUNGWON says, ""Tower."" In the **reverse shot**, we indeed see a tower. Only vampires can ""see"" the tower through some sort of mysticism.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/ododkjhlie0f1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd9e82b9b3fd17d194cf7a2da426d9eac4f5acf9)

AHHHHH!!! Excuse me.

Sorry.

Coolest scene in the film.

Anyway, I read some speculation that SUNGHOON in the film owns a **gay club**. The beauty of film lies in its openness to interpretation—I wholeheartedly believe that there should be something in it for *everyone*. A single scene can hold a hundred meanings, each one shaped by our identity and experiences. A disabled viewer might see themselves in Jake Sully from ***Avatar***, connecting with his longing, his transformation, or his fight for agency. Others might see something entirely different.

Film reflects us back to ourselves, even when we're all looking at the same screen.

However, calling this a gay club is not only inaccurate, it's misleading. While I long for a time when all marginalized communities can feel truly seen and represented, labeling something in this way crosses into the territory of baiting. It risks exploiting our hope for representation rather than honoring them.

In this order, we see a...

A woman.

A woman talking to a man.

A long-haired man talking to a woman. You can see the masculine features in the hand and side profile.

A woman touching the cheek of a man.

A woman talking to a man who gets handed a drink by another man (who has these cool, milky eyes—*vampiresssss*).

No one ""makes out.""

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/1xalw1ypke0f1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=e69723ff2d538886443c8cb5fd313982ea8beb93)

We get SUNGHOON, bathed in red light again, in a **medium-wide**. A medium-wide shot frames the subject from knees up. Park Minsu also placed the camera at a **low angle**, which establishes power and dominance, and considering his posturing, SUNGHOON indeed dominates.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/3t55p3n7me0f1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=4abdaa3159b574a23eb4fe198a0eba9a7b0df840)

Interestingly, Park Minsu breaks the **180-degree rule**. Imagine a line drawn straight between two characters facing each other. Our camera must stay on one side of that line—the 180-degree arc—so that the characters always appear on the same side of the screen relative to each other. If you cross that line with the camera, it flips their positions on screen, which breaks the spatial logic of the scene.

Park Minsu established SUNGHOON in the right quadrant of the screen, and JUNGWON and SUNOO in the left. We should get a shot on the opposite side of this frame, with SUNOO in the foreground, and JUNGWON in the midground.

I love the way SUNOO delivers his line, ""We've waited too long.""

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/gbntuzsxne0f1.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6c4fa429626261200ada04996a19e7c80992343)

Now Park Minsu gets intentional with the neck exposure.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/94kkaju8re0f1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=58703328b138ea8c70e59332cf0ed3d9c7119cef)

ENGENE, JAKE truly shines in his role for the next few shots.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/0a7t6k71se0f1.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579351c8b5132bfe0def3aead11a07c69f49b79)

Park Minsu set JAKE at a 3/4 angle to establish **negative space** in the background, enough to fit a glowing-eyed monster. Just the blocking of this shot should tell us that JAKE may be under the influence of the monster. Now, from a thematic perspective, by placing the monster in the negative space, invisible to everyone else, we emphasize how *isolating* it can be to carry something others cannot see—whether an internal darkness, or a negative state of mind. JAKE sits alone with it. It shapes everything he says.

Is JAKE truly speaking his mind? Or is he merely a mouthpiece for something darker, more subconscious, or systemic?

Or maybe Park Minsu wanted to drive home the idea of *duality*. Charm and danger, life and death, desire and restraint. This monster could be the embodiment of his true nature—his hunger, violence, or truth. Its placement in the frame suggests *suppression*. Yet, it whispers in his ear—ever-present and unavoidable.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/kgs87yjote0f1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f52f423204b9821db27c8621ca95c27dc8dba0a)

This medium-close shot of JAY may represent JAKE, or even the monster, winning over him. Park Minsu uses another dolly in. Unsettling. Intentional.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/tgs6gti8ue0f1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=6396edb38cbc25717d126d2c631c57b6c27fc55f)

Confirmed in the next shot. JAY seems to be fighting against these inner demons. He has retreated into his mind. Absent, not present.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/3mlqxxboue0f1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb946c2cc859a6d8d9629909f454d89643bf45b)

We get a wide shot to establish the power going out, and SUNSUNWON disappearing. As soon as the power blinks out, something has sprung into action. This is the signal.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/om1nwoj7ve0f1.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=030e9d637db09f9214667642c8360bb6dc0bc723)

Do you remember what I said about **high angles**? We watch the power go out, and the power dynamics shift. From this moment on, Park Minsu shifts to **handheld shots**. If you remember my breakdown of the UNTOLD Cinema Concept, you know that handheld shots emphasize energy, movement. We can see a shift in the atmosphere. Actors (fake audience) and camera have been injected with *fear*.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/oz447ixwve0f1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e62bf3f216b4e684d1e716cf0083660e36c8bab)

A missed opportunity to reveal something or someone *behind* him.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/ho9c5vptwe0f1.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28be0d54852da1c3c60ab50a2456f8a67408b14)

A *beautiful* transition from HEESEUNG to NI-KI. We get a reflection in the mirror of both his desire (to be human) and his darkness.

I’ve posted twice already, y’all watched me spiral like a Disney villain falling into glittery doom. At this point I don't even watch content like a normal person. I absorb it. Osmosis-style.

WHY DID I DO THAT???
HEESEUNG. CAME. FOR. MY. THROAT.
That man didn’t even knock. He just walked right back into my heart like he paid rent there. My ILAND bias really said “you thought you moved on???”

Currently drowning in EN-O’CLOCK episodes while sobbing, giggling, and occasionally pausing to scream into my pillow. It’s fine. Everything’s fine.

Jay: started the downfall, I’ll never forgive him

Heeseung: original bias and current emotional damage dealer

Sunoo: wrecker with ✨main character energy✨ and sparkly menace vibes


And NIKI.
He is a menace and also half my age. I don’t even bias him, I parent him. I watch him dance and get emotional like, “That’s my baby. Look at him go.” I didn’t birth him but spiritually? I did.

Last year, I'd been a cinematography student, learning the ropes of filmmaking by analyzing the moving picture (including the [Romance: Untold Cinema](https://www.reddit.com/r/enhypen/comments/1dm52kf/thoughts_on_the_concept_cinema_from_a/)). Since then, I have sat in the coveted chair as director, watching my scripts come to life frame-by-frame.

After reading the articles put out yesterday regarding the premiere, I took the liberty of re-watching ***Late Night with the Devil***, so expect some references!

I will be breaking the concept cinema down shot-by-shot, so you can get an idea of some of the creative intentions and deeper themes of ***Desire: Unleash***.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/x7hjtj09j60f1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fead60b42a04cf27c39487a4d2f37da98f3485c)

If you know anything about film, or even about writing, you know that the first shot, the first sentence, should make the most impact. It sets the tone. It often serves as the foundation of your story moving forward.

Park Minsu gave us a shot of the moon.

*Why?*

We get the answer 30 seconds in. Before I dissect that though, I want to give a brief explanation as to how directors put together a shot list.

A shot list, at its core, should be comprised of four elements: frame size, subject, angle, and movement. We could get into the specifics of lens sizes, equipment, and modes of sound—but at its core, these four elements *tell the story*, while the last three (lens, equipment, sound) fall under a more technical category that should be deliberated with your camera department, primarily your director of photography.

Anyway! This first shot can be classified as an EXTREME WIDE, often used in or as **establishing shots**. Wide frame sizes, like the establishing shot, set up the context of the scene, and often take precedence in your shooting schedule, being that the first shot in most film and television tends to be the establishing shot (and also for additional *technical* reasons, such as extensive setup, continuity, etc.).

We know our subject, but what about the movement?

We **tilt down**. Why? Look at the architecture. It looks like New York. A vista of gothic skyscrapers, contrasted by a neoclassical building in the center.  Park Minsu wanted to *establish* that the setting of Desire: Unleash take places in America. Or at the very least, outside of Korea.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/enjd39vln60f1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=85569a49601d0562ed5545ab7eaed4ab0568b53a)

Back to the moon.

*It turns red*.

A bit on the nose with the symbolism—red for desire and lust, of course, but for danger and blood(-thirstiness) too. We get a cool closeup of SUNGHOON, with the moon in his eye, bathed in red light. On a thematic level, we can assume that SUNGHOON has been consumed by his desire\*—\*his lust and hunger for blood. In this moment, SUNGHOON embraces a feral vampiric drive.

From a plot standpoint, we can infer that something about *this* moon on *this* night spurs SUNGHOON, SUNOO, and JUNGWON into action. We call this the **catalyst**—and the catalyst drives the story forward, giving our characters a goal. JUNGWON confirms this, ""It has started.""

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/l9mbnss9v60f1.png?width=1137&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf9e36042f2c6a50c0fa16710f48c38f6826403)

Do you remember what I said about wide shots? What did Park Minsu do? He started wide and pushed in. We call this a **dolly in**. Park may have used a Dana Dolly (in my short time as director, I have been partial to this movement and piece of equipment). We use a dolly in to immerse the audience into the scene, but it could also be used for deeper thematic purposes.

Replay 00:41. Again. Again. What do you notice about HEESEUNG?

Pain. He takes a sharp breath, clamps it down. (By far, my favorite scene. Such a small moment, but so much emotional depth. 10/10 delivery, HEESEUNG!).

A dolly in may represent that pain closing in on him—whether that pain comes from withdrawal, suppressed desire, or even conflict within the family.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/0tev7r1kx60f1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=25621aff37ac48fe12437016d6076cfe86221822)

In the next shot, we actually get shot-to-shot inspiration from ***Late Night with the Devil***. Due to copyright reasons, I will refrain from posting the exact shot, but you can find it in the opening scene!

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/ctfap9xzx60f1.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb3256199edea7a626225e54f7f820b256bce99b)

We pan back to HEE-- Wait, no. **NI-KI**.

What do you notice about NI-KI compared to HEESEUNG?

He looks stoic. Unamused. Bitter or angry, even.

I think the switch represents not only this duality between human and vampire, but also a shift in feelings, a change in emotion as soon as HEESEUNG sees JAY. He may wish to be there with him. Maybe HEESEUNG, represented by NI-KI, feels an element of resentment or envy. Whatever it may be, NI-KI and JAKE seem to be the metaphorical yins to the yangs of HEESEUNG and JAY.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/3xnkuhma070f1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd77ca1cf169eda0713a40e2010b61bd57e151c)

This over the shoulder shot—a cinematic masterpiece. Again, we have the theme of duality, of warring emotions and desires. JAKE will go down in history as the MVP in this concept cinema. He had such a subtly nuanced performance, from the line delivery with ""*Because I want to be seen*,"" to the small choices in movement, especially in his eyes, during ""*To remind you that I exist. To remind myself*.""

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/1606r6lj170f1.png?width=1137&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e914dbbd961985d8e5602753c106b59cf99e3c)

You can tell JAY studied for his role. He oozes charisma. 'Nuff said.

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/z47mhnyl270f1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ccbe93afa5b0667d54728953763dc2b44f5e90)

HEESEUNG looks tortured. Something eats at him. We use closeups like this to let the audience in on *a specific, significant emotion*. I like to think, too, that NI-KI may be starting to win, may be starting to influence HEESEUNG. He starts to fantasize...

[ENHYPEN \(엔하이픈\) DESIRE Concept Cinema](https://preview.redd.it/788vgdt2370f1.png?width=1135&format=png&auto=webp&s=f704009690f38fca7578293998fcba11df935d95)

We get a peak inside his mind. We see what he wants, what he covets deep in his heart. But we also see fear, and fear sours the image of SOOHA/CHLOE. Both parts, light and dark, vampire and human, NI-KI and HEESEUNG, desire the same thing. Only one knows the cost.

Stay tuned for PART 2!

In the meantime, celebrate your moms (or mother figures) today! 🫶🫶",130,19

In the desire concept cinema.,"Just watched the desire concept cinema, heeseung really stood out to me, he seems like the most natrual one in terms of acting, his eyes are very expressive and the way he says his lines is very natrual didn't feel like acting. And omg jake where did that come from ?! His facial expressions were on point, i think his only weak point would be the way he says his lines, sounds rather robotic and awkward but other then that he played the villain part perfectly, his eyes .... damnnn. All them improved alot in terms of acting, even sunghoon facial expressions improved. 
Back to heeseung, he can truly branch out in acting later in his life if he wants, he's a natural, his acting doesn't feel awkward  at all.",111,12

Love Heeseung's expressions all throughout the video. 

Ni-ki may not have a lot of dialogues while acting, but he did have narrations. And I'm glad. I love his voice hehe.

I'm bad at theorizing so I'm leaving it to you guys. Are they inhabiting the same body? They're the only ones disconnected from the interview scene. So idk how they fit into the story. It almost feels like they're inside the monster and the monster is inside Jay/Jake but it's so far off lol

Sunghoon has the least amount of screentime, I think, but he still did great. He made sipping blood so attractive lmao.

Jay and Jake are the stars of this video for me. It makes sense for the story. I love Jake's subtle expressions. He didn't seem awkward at all. 

I love Jay's delivery of his dialogues. He made the words sound gentle, like he was no threat at all. The American accent is 🤌

(I' skipping some more specific spoilers they dropped accidentally about the content of the cinema and concepts).

Heeseung spoiled on the live stream talk that the title is called >!Bad Desire!< 

Jake said the album is very bold and very ""Enhypen style"" so even new fans listening should get their charm, Hee said that the theme of desire is core and connected between the cinema and the album.The blood/vampire theme is strong.

Director confirmed the short film is inspired by late night with the devil, Jay watched the movie and took some inspiration from the series Lucifer for his character.

 They finished the album and most of the prep before they left for coachella.
Sunoo said before they expressed a more innocent love but they are more mature so they are portraying love with desire.

During the audience chat Jay-Jake-Ni-ki asked what song vibes engenes like, the audience said given-taken and criminal love and they said people who liked those will like the new title. (I will take this with some grain of salt) Sunoo said the title is something new.

enhypen,1kjbydy,2025-05-10 16:45:53,Desire Comeback support guide 🏆,"This post is for ENGENEs who would like to know more about fandom support for charting, music shows and how we can make this a successful era for Enhypen! Most important is - have fun!

**Content:**

* **Global Charting**
* **Winning on Music Shows**
* **Streaming and Other tips**

# I. Charting

**Enhypen charting high on global and local country charts help reward their work, introduce them to new listeners, ensure their career longevity. Local chart performance also shows Belift the regional demand for tours/festivals.**

**General/Simple things that help:**

* Listen to the album/title track officially on platforms available to you (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music, Deezer, Pandora, etc. - not reuploads/pirated versions) - if you are using free versions consider signing up for a free premium trial that will last you during comeback as premium streams count more for charts - you can follow fanbases that create playlists for you:  [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/nmfruj8v82b01hv6mm5rab9en?si=4av3u77sSRymFgiYrWLb2g&pi=wwWILnyLSqyTS), [YT Music](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UC-dCdmjvPFZTvo8NHKICTVQ?si=VifKCBD6nxRtaaM3). Spotify and Apple music often offer 2-3 month free trials or discounts for new or returning users.
* Pre-order or buy physical albums during the first week of tracking if you are planning to buy - check your country's restrictions (e.g. BB counts up to 4 per version, Arya counts only 1) to make your purchases count.
* **Buy digital versions of the album/song starting from FRIDAY** as most charts track Fri-Thur - buy the full album not the individual songs to help the album charts (e.g. iTunes, Amazon Music). If you only buy 1 song that will count towards song charts. You have to download the purchase as well to count for certain charts. Digital purchases on release day (Thursday) especially for the US/EU will not help charting much as there will only be 1 day of tracking for that week.
* When watching the MV give it a like, comment, click share so it gets on the country trending page, and gets pushed to recommended feeds - some country charts also count Youtube streams (e.g. Billboard)
* Shazam the songs - this can help with the song getting better playlisting, appear on recommendations and reach more listeners!
* Create or engage with shortform content using the songs to help reach more new listeners

*More detailed tips for different platforms will be further down the thread!*

**Album charts:**

Album charts count a combination of physical sales, digital sales and streams. In general premium/paid (Spotify premium, YT Music, Apple Music, etc.) streams weigh much more than free streams. Many countries also have restrictions on physical/digital copies per person or the album inclusions (e.g. UK charts will only count digitals and vinyl sales due to a restriction on randomized inclusions like photocards. Billboard only counts up to 4 album copies per version per buyer).

*Examples: Billboard 200 (US/PR), Oricon (JP), SNEP (FR), Arya (AUS)*

There our local country charts and also platform specific album charts e.g. on Apple Music and Spotify.

**Song charts:**

Song charts usually count a combination of streams, downloads, song purchases and radio play.

*Examples: Billboard Hot 100 (US/PR), Billboard Japan Hot 100, Circle Digital Chart (KR)*

There are also platform specific song charts (most important: Spotify Top Songs, Youtube Weekly, Shazam) - if a song charts well (high and consistently!) it can be added to more playlists, gain more attention, be played on radio - all can help Enhypen get a hit song and gain more listeners!

Platforms have streaming restrictions to keep in mind: continuously looped, vpn streams are often filtered, and there could be a daily cap on how many times your streams on the same song counts for charts. For Spotify we have a fanbase and [guides here](https://x.com/EN_onSpotify/status/1789605475610456526). Some more tips on platforms are at the end of the thread.

# II. Music Shows

**What music shows are we focusing on?**

1.       M Countdown - counts global streaming

2.       Music Bank - digitals are spread so physical sales and votes weigh more

3.       Inkigayo – global streaming now counts for points if the song has enough domestic streams for eligibility, still hard to win but we have more of a chance now!

4.       Music Core - hard to win without good domestic digitals

5.       Show Champion - hard to win without attendance, and EN stopped attending

Most music shows track from Monday to Sunday so we will only have 4 days of tracking for 1^(st) week, and the chances for week 2 are usually low because album sales get lower and there could be other comebacks with higher sales/digital score that week.

Music shows always count the previous week, so even if Enhypen is nominated on their first week of promotion on the voting apps - DO NOT VOTE YET on cb week! Some shows put up the songs early but during the shows taking place between June 5-11 we will not have any eligible charting or album sales. We will post on the sub when a voting we should target opens!

**How can you contribute to Music Show wins:**

Basically everything listed under the general tips for charting contributes for Music Show wins as well.

* Listen to the album/title track on official platforms available to you (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music, Melon etc. - not reupload/pirated versions) and watch the MV (liking and sharng on all these platforms helps boost the song)
* Engage with/create shortform content with the songs on Tiktok, IG Reels, YT Shorts
* Pre-order or purchase the physical album during the tracking period, if you are planning to buy
* Download, collect on voting apps (more info on the apps under the specific shows)
* If you have spare time and want to help more consider joining a voting or streaming team (more about them at the end of the thread)

Here is an overview of the tracking, voting and airing dates for all the music shows:

# Streaming and Other Tips

**Spotify:**

* Don’t loop the songs - replaying them a few times is okay, but if you want to listen repeatedly or stream more to help the album and songs chart, rotate between playing the song/album and playlists that have 2-3 other songs between the title track (if you don’t want to make your own there will be ones [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/nmfruj8v82b01hv6mm5rab9en?si=af684443e94f42b7).) If you have a premium account you can join a stationhead party where a host will do that for you. It is speculated that Spotify counts \~ 20 streams from 1 account towards charts every day, so if you have time you can rotate between up to 6 accounts to make more of your listens count towards the charts.
* Play the songs from curated playlists e.g. New Music Friday, K-Pop ON! – these plays get filtered less, and help the songs stay on the playlists longer!
* Don’t continuously loop, don’t mute Spotify, don’t skip before the song is played at least 30-40 seconds.

**Youtube:**

* Youtube has been stricter with view and like filtering (especially on the Hybe channel) and might only count a few views per hour and may even have a daily cap! To make the most out of Youtube it’s better to spread out re-watching the MV throughout the day instead of viewing it repeatedly in quick successions. Replaying it a few times is not an issue (you do that when you like something naturally) but don’t try to constantly replay it, don’t refresh the browser to replay or play it 5+ times per hour because the views will just get filtered.
* Engagement such as likes, comments, shares, clicks from external platforms can boost the video to people’s recommended feed, get on the trending pages and that would be our main goal so more people can check out the comeback!

**If you would like to do more there are other things you can participate in:**

* **Stationhead** \- If you have Spotify premium or Apple Music using Stationhead is a good way to stream. Enhypen holds a few official streaming events during cbs and fandom Stationhead DJs also host 24/7, you can just join the ENGENE channel and they play the songs and rotate between playlists for you!
* **Duckad** \- Duckad is a voting app that lets you donate collected votes for song streams on Bugs, Genie, Melon, Youtube and Spotify. [Tutorial here](https://encreaseteam.wixsite.com/en-crease/post/duckad-digital).
* **Voting and Streaming teams** \- Voting teams are a way to get guidance and strategies for the apps or even extra accounts to vote with. Streaming teams are usually focused on domestic apps or Spotify and they fund the passes! If you have time to dedicate but no money to spend they are a good option. They are mostly on twitter (some IG) with groupchats on discord/telegram ask in the comments/message if you are looking for some!
* **Local fanbases** \- Many country fanbases do projects and fund digital purchases or streaming passes to enter the local charts, they are mainly on Twitter and IG.

*Feel free to add any useful info or fanbases you know! Let me know if there is anything else you would like to see or if you see any mistakes!*

You can use this thread to discuss ideas or ask for help about anything related to this topic! Hope you enjoy this comeback and we can witness another very successful Enhypen era!

Jay had already mentioned the ""shocking"" thing before on his birthday live, along with saying there will be a lot of new things - and he emphasized ""good new"".

enhypen,1kijplk,2025-05-09 16:22:17,How to buy or make photocards and goodies (in Germany)?,"Hi Engenes,
I need a bit of help and advice (sorry for my bad English)
I have a little girl, 12 years old, who is a big Enhypen Fan. Her bias is Sunghoon.
Some days ago, I tried all I could for many many hours to get Tickets for Berlin, to make her biggest dream come true.. but I failed. I was quick, but everything was already sold out. 

I know, you maybe think, she is 12.. it’s a good lection to learn, that you can’t always get what you want. But it has broken my heart, because she reacted exactly how I imagined she would:

When she came home from school, I told her, that I failed and she smiled and hugged me and said it’s okay, she is fine and she thanked me for trying it. She tried to comfort me and tried to be silent as she was crying in her bedroom. She didn’t want me to hear her and feel bad.

So I want to surprise her otherwise and preordered the new album and I tried to buy photocards.. but that is so strange and I don’t know.. how it is the best way to be safe? There are not many in my hometown (just one and I don’t understand „pcs from slide 1 have to be bought with pcs from slide 2!“ ?? There are two pics with some photocards..hmm) and for others, who would ship, how could I could that they ship after sending the money? How can I check if the cards are real?

Or .. ahh.. just writing this, Etsy comes in my mind..  maybe I could check, if they have something like a sunghoon package.. 

I know, she don’t mind it, if the cards are not real.. but as the cards are really expensive on the market, I want to make sure, but I have no idea. 

Or I could do some of my own? My printer is really bad. 

Do you have any ideas except checking Etsy and looking for tutorials how to make photocards? 

I am army and when I watch something about bts in the cinema, I something get such great goodies made by other armys who wants to promote their fanmade merch shop. How can I find such shops for enhypen in Germany?? 

Sorry for the long text and thanks in Advanced for your ideas.

enhypen,1ki1ty3,2025-05-08 23:30:30,Send help again 😭 I'm new in this place,"Y’ALL. I CAME HERE LAST WEEK TO CASUALLY MENTION THAT JAY WAS DRAGGING ME INTO ENHYPEN AND NOW I’M IN TOO DEEP. I HAVEN’T SEEN THE SUN IN 3 BUSINESS DAYS. I’M WATCHING EN-OCLOCK LIKE IT’S NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. JAY, IF YOU SEE THIS, YOU OWE ME THERAPY.

But here’s the kicker: I’m obsessed but confused. I love them but I don’t get them yet. Is it the age gap? Is it the fact that I have back pain from simply existing? Possibly.

AND ANOTHER THING, WHAT IS GOING ON WITH SUNOO? I SAY THIS AS A CERTIFIED DELULU IN TRAINING: IS THERE GROUP TENSION OR IS HE JUST THE VIBRANT, DRAMATIC ICON I THINK HE IS?? Why do I feel like there’s tea and no one is serving it??

So anyway what's your favorite enhypen album. Personally my favorite enhypen album till now has been orange blood. I just love the concept and the songs are cheff kiss especially orange flower. But I also love dark blood because of its concept and aesthetic and the performance. And it also really shows the vampire concept and the songs are so good. If I had to rank my top 3 albums it would be: 1. Orange blood 2. Dark blood 3. Memorabilia or Romance Untold. Honestly I love all enhypen albums they are so good. Tell me your favorite enhypen album.

We don't have much to go on just the packaging previews with some quotes and the version names (even the pc previews are super hidden this time) but could be fun! The first Make version drops on May 16th so we should have time until then.

Rules:   
I'll post a 2x2 grid for an album version with the package preview and you comment a pic you think the aesthetic will resemble. The top 4 voted pics will be entered into the grid!

Similarly to the previous game official enhypen MV/Concept pictures aren't allowed.

enhypen,1kgw112,2025-05-07 14:24:34,What are common misinfo/non-enhypen pics you often see in the fandom?,"Got reminded of these after seeing the pic of the kid with hair rollers that many engenes still think is baby Jungwon, but it's actually Jimin of JustB.

https://preview.redd.it/v21hue74lcze1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea6d5d38bb75d4c70fdd6e4184dacb7665a9ecd8

Jimin and Geonu showed this pic in a live years ago: [here](https://youtu.be/w1milaIulIs?si=nE-RgpAY2N44ksjn) they hold it up around the 57 second mark. Since Jimin was an I-land contestant too maybe his pics were shared at that time and people mixed them up?

I still see engenes on twitter and tiktok with this pic as their pfp.

Pinterest is so good to look up pics, but soo many mistaken pics there esp with baby pics, and people in the comments would even insist on it being an enha member when it isn't.

Another also Jungwon (this is unserious probably everyone forgot) is there was a live he did in the practice room (the one with the ""jelly!"" [here](https://weverse.io/enhypen/live/3-138318844) ), he tried to do the slickback challenge and joked with the chat, but people on tiktok made up that he cried because the chat made fun of him😭😭 his eyes were just very shiny the whole live he didn't cry and when he said ""don't tease me"" it was clearly just lighthearted banter with fans, but saw multiple tiktoks with hundred thousand likes claiming he was holding back tears and hurt or something with all the comments believing it.

Do you have any other misinfo or pics you see being shared a lot that you often have to correct? Would be cool to have some with sources for corrections collected here, just lighthearted stuff.",39,20
enhypen,1kgug75,2025-05-07 12:57:42,Thoughts on Ni-ki wearing Heeseungs clothes in the trailer???,"In the concept photos, he's been consistently ""shadowing"" hee as well. (standing behind him, which none of the others were, or in the first photo where he's blended in the background/blurred/ translucent? like he's inside hee's head)

""does he control himself or does it control him?"" could this be tied to ni-ki and heeseung?

Could he be controlling him or something? What about sunoo from drunk dazed? I thought Sunoo was like the 'ring leader'? He seemed to be carrying out a mission in drunk dazed. (I still wonder how Jungwon got outside in given taken..if it was him)

edit: The units... JayKe are wearing similar clothes, so are HoonSunWon (though Sunoo stands out a bit more...) , but it seems HeeKi are wearing the exact same outfit.

Ni-ki's also the only member who was not shown properly in the close up photos

Jay and Jake seem to be one person as well???? Sitting in the same position, same suit, even though only 1 vampire was brought to the studio?

Sunoo and Jungwon are giving detective vibes tbh, so maybe there's a rift in between the boys now (they have been fighting lately.) Heeseung seems to be observing sunoo or jay? Sunoos scene in the elevator makes it look like he knows he's being watched..

Jake's just sus and I think that was his eye, heeseung was drinking blood...

from my understanding, a lot of webtoon series like orv cannot have some things sold, but does it also go for dark moon? e.g. if we make fanart/ or cosplay as dark moon characters and sell them is that acceptable?

Enhypenthoughts,1lgk0bg,2025-06-21 02:53:58,Why does ENHYPEN not get more wins?,"I am so proud of ENHYPEN and ENGENE for their growth and love for one another that has only become stronger since debut. Desire: Unleashed has truly been one of the best comebacks in a long time when it comes to music shows. I love ENHYPEN more than anything, and I want to show that to them with wins.

However, I can't help but wonder why they never get more than 3 trophies at a time per comeback.

I understand that sometimes there is strong competition, such as SEVENTEEN's Thunder during Bad Desire (With or Without You) promotions.

With other 4th generation boy groups like ATEEZ winning 6 times with Guerilla, or 4th generation girl groups like IVE winning 11 times with Rebel Heart, even 5th generation boy groups like TWS winning 6 times with Countdown!, I wonder when it is ENHYPEN's time to dominate with wins.

In addition, they have only just gotten their first Inkigayo win last week. They still have yet to win on Music Core, almost 5 years after debut.

Why has ENHYPEN and ENGENE's not had the voting power to secure wins for more than one week of promotions? I want to see them win more than three awards at a time, but it seems to be unobtainable for them.

What reasons do you think this is for? Will there ever be a time when they can truly get the recognition they deserve in award shows?",37,29

Not js what suits ur vibe or whatever but what song do u think is just PERFECTLY made  the vocals, lyrics, choreo, background music, the outfits from that era etc.

For me, ever since it came out its been future perfect. I really think manifesto day 1 ( and also romance untold) was enhypens peak, and each member stood out SM in this er. The song suits not only the members but the group as a whole, and you can TELL that they lovee performing it. Literally the whole group AND the audience get hyped up and that intro is ICONIC, as well as the choreography ( which I think is enhypen's best choreo).  At coachella, at concerts etc the vibe is ALWAYS there. In my head, its enha's anthem, and no matter how many good songs come out, in my head this will always be the best.

Enhypenthoughts,1lf7lj6,2025-06-19 12:40:09,You want a Daesang for Enhypen? THIS IS THEIR ERA.,"Stop worrying about future comebacks. Focus on the one **now**.


We lost a very, very easy win in MCountdown because Engenes stopped streaming/voting in the 2nd week. **It could've been their 4th win. They've never had 4 wins.**


I know there are concerns about Enha being tired, but are you actually listening to them? They're burning with excitement. They're excited about this comeback and they're already crazy about their future music. They're working out of passion and ambition. They're even choosing to compose music in their private time.


**They want this.** They want to win Daesangs. They want to break records. They want to reach new heights. They want to enter a new era of Enhypen explosively. 


These aren’t my words. These are theirs.


So listen to them.


Stop getting caught up in rumors about October comebacks or January comebacks. None of those are even official announcements but ya'll are crashing out about it. These are literally rumors only. **We are in a comeback right now.** We need to show up for them.


This is our chance to give them the Daesangs they deserve. We don't want to look back at the end-of-year awards with regrets. **We don’t want to watch Heeseung comfort us again if we lose.**


We're so close. We're up against huge groups like 3rd gen and this is the moment Engenes need to come together and give Enha everything. It's up to us to make miracles. Enha only has us. 


Remember MAMA. Don’t forget the look on their faces when they almost won. Don’t forget the way Heeseung had to hold us together. Don't forget the way Sunoo cried when we won.


This year, we should be celebrating them. 2025 is Enhypen's year.


Focus on the present. Focus on the now.


**Stream playlists on Spotify. Open up Stationhead. Participate in Voting polls. Follow voting accounts. Keep talking about them. Hype them up. Every person's effort matters.**


This comeback is not over. Don't hold back. 


Make this era of Enhypen burn so bright that they can't be ignored anymore. It's really just the beginning.",177,31
Enhypenthoughts,1lf3tpi,2025-06-19 08:31:21,Bad Desire MV Concept,"Just wanna share a little appreciation post for the Bad Desire MV. I’m an art director at an advertising agency and honestly, this is the first Enhypen MV that feels like a true visual masterpiece to me (respectfully)

The storytelling here is so cohesive. You really see the title and lyrics come to life visually like, you get the message. It captures why it’s called “Bad Desire” and how desire is part of the human psyche. It’s not always black and white, not simply good or evil, it exists in that grey area. And the MV nailed that nuance.

My favorite frame has to be Sunoo’s. The emotion in that shot? Beautiful. The audio-visual lock, the ambience, the way it all just clicks makes you feel that moment where he’s just giving in to the “Bad Desire.” It’s such a complex emotion but so tangible.

To all my fellow design people out there if you’re looking for inspo or visual references, Bad Desire is a goldmine. Go study that MV 😉",90,7

I have always enjoyed the Killing Voice performances bc they showcase the idols and their groups well. I think they are perfect for those who don’t know what to look for or want to discover a new group. They are also really enjoyable for the fan favorites that us k-pop lovers can’t get enough of. Example: Taemin. 

Enha sounds great individually and great collectively. Also, I’m a fairly new engene and this performance allows me to see who has the growly, raspy voice and who is hitting the high notes like vocal kings. The range is crazy. Another example, Bite Me is a song that I like but I’m not in love with it like other engenes. Hearing it live like that and hearing the tones, mini duets, just all the things that make that song great, made me appreciate that song more. Blind was a highlight for me. I don’t hear that song enough and hearing it again made me happy. 

I know I’m going a bit overboard but I love Enha and I love Killing Voice. The two together is perfection. ",49,2

Enhypenthoughts,1ldlds0,2025-06-17 14:06:35,Let’s talk about idol vocal health: a case with heeseung.,"Edit: CAN SOMEONE WARN HIM!!??

Heeseung is hands down one of the most talented and emotionally expressive vocalists of 4th gen. His voice is clean, warm, and always so full of emotions. But lately, especially during the Desire: Unleash era, I’ve been noticing things in his live performances that have me genuinely worried for his vocal health.

There are some of the patterns I’ve observed:

His neck muscles are constantly flexing when singing, even in softer or mid-range parts — it looks like physical tension, not just emotional engagement. He tends to let go of notes with a squeak or sudden release, especially at the end of longer lines or higher phrases. In their encore (esp. the intro line in ""BAD DESIRE""), his pitch comes out lower or more unstable than the studio version— but in all member fancams, his pitch sounds more accurate, which suggests it might not just be a mixing issue but maybe vocal fatigue.

These squeaks and tension weren’t as present in older performances (like during I-LAND or early BORDER eras), but now they seem consistent—almost like a habit or coping mechanism. I’m not saying he’s bad now— no, not at all. His talent is unreal, but I’m afraid that with how often he sings live, combined with intense choreo and constant promotions, he might be compensating with muscle tension instead of deep breath support. It reminds me of what happened to Jimin from BTS who also had a beautiful, emotional voice that gradually developed similar signs of vocal stress (neck tension, pitch drops, squeaks, etc.) after years of overuse and pressure.

And that’s what scares me— not a ""bad performance,"" but the long-term risk of pushing a naturally gifted voice too hard without enough recovery or technical support.

I’d love to know if

Has anyone else noticed these changes?
Do you think the squeak is stylistic or a sign of vocal fatigue?
Should companies be more cautious about how often idols sing live without vocal rest?

At the end of the day, I just want Heeseung to stay healthy and sing for many more years. He has one of the most special voices in K-pop—I hope hybe or belift care enough.
No hate, just love and concern.
Would love to hear you guys' thoughts. ",146,94

From the visuals to the music. I'm just curious as a new engene what that was like? Was everybody gagged? Did everyone like the new sound?

Most lyric sites and color-coded videos say he sings ""And now I'm alive,"" but when I listen closely, it sounds more like ""And now I'm in the light.""  His pronunciation here is a bit unclear, which is unusual since his English is usually pretty clear.

It's so heartwarming for me anyway to see so many people recognise him as top2 vocalist of the group, talking about his vocals, appreciating him for his hard work.

Enhypenthoughts,1ldwlrz,2025-06-17 21:35:10,Proud of Enhypen but they nee some rest,"Sometimes I forget just how much Enhypen has been through. Overworked, barely resting, always moving from one schedule to the next. And yet, now stepping into their 5th year, they’ve accomplished so much.
From rookie awards to Daesangs, Billboard charting albums, sold-out tours, and collaborations with global brands, they’ve done it all.

And not just as a group, but as individuals too. Modeling, MC roles, choreography, songwriting… It’s crazy to think about how far they’ve come in such a ,,short"" time.

I really wish I had become an Engene during I-Land, just so I could’ve supported them from the very beginning. But even now, I’m so incredibly proud of them – of their growth and  passion.

Their recent comeback was amazing, the album turned out beautiful in every way: musically, visually, emotionally. But as excited as I am about it, I can’t help but worry. With everything going on: the comeback and the upcoming world tour, it’s clear they’re being pushed hard by Hybe. And as fans, we have to acknowledge that they need rest too.

It’s honestly upsetting to see fake or toxic “fans” tearing them down when they’re already under so much pressure, especially over small or harmless things. They need support, not criticism

Please remember to vote for them when you get the chance. They’ve come so far, and they really deserve to feel how much we’re behind them

Enhypenthoughts,1ld4xcm,2025-06-16 23:13:39,is ENHYPEN overworked?,"So after Ni-ki mentioned the demo today in his live, there have been a lot of different opinions about it.

But I mostly see ENGENEs that are happy and think it's normal that groups come out with two albums a year (in K-pop), and I agree that it's normal in the K-pop industry, but just because it is normalized doesn't make it easy and not hard for them.

Of course, ENHYPEN are all grown men that can make their own decisions and they know their own limits. But they are still human and need a good break. 

I understand that they want to make engene happy, and they are very eager to perform and show who ENHYPEN is to the world. Which, of course, is a very good thing, but it has been around three years since they started their first tour and have basically been on tour ever since, with breaks in between but also having comebacks and a busy schedule. 

This year has been incredibly busy for them, with tours, Coachella, two albums, and other things like festivals and award shows. 

But in the end, we don't know them personally, so we don't know if they are overworked or having a hard time, we only know what they tell us.

Of course, I'm also happy about getting new music from them, but it still makes me wonder if this is too much when they are also going on a very physically demanding tour soon, and I kind of thought that before their tour they would get a break, but now that they have begun on the next album, it makes me think they won't get a break.

But the only thing we know is that Ni-ki is very excited about this album, so we should be too. Also, the album is only demos right now (from what we know), so it's going to be months before it comes out.

what do you think??

Enhypenthoughts,1lch6bk,2025-06-16 04:02:30,Calling Out Bullying and Division In Our Fandom,"ENGENE! 

I want to bring up a sensitive topic that has been circulating in this subreddit for quite some time. Recently, I’ve witnessed (and personally experienced) some pretty blatant bullying and gatekeeping—not just of individual fans, but of Reddit ENGENE as a whole. These people often disguise their behavior as “advocacy” or “calling out mistreatment,” but in reality, create division and drive people away instead of building support for our idols.

Our fandom should be a space where we can come together, share passion, and support the group we love—not tear each other down or police how others advocate for ENHYPEN.  Personal attacks, mockery, ridicule, belittling and condescension—labeling us as “not supportive enough” or “toxic” comes across as *bullying*, plain and simple.

We should be holding companies, management, and even the fandom accountable when needed. But if the way we do it pushes away more fans than it brings in, we're doing something *wrong*.

ENGENE, we should be focusing on the facts, not assumptions or personal vendettas. We should be respecting different way people show support. We should avoid generalization about ENGENE as a whole, and speak up against bullying and gatekeeping. 

Beyond addressing these conflicts, I believe our fandom has found itself at an important crossroads. We need to move from the “survival show” fanbase clinging to the drama and competition, and step into opportunity—and responsibility—to grow into a community that genuinely supports the group as a *whole*. 

  
This fandom has a knack for hyper-analyzing member and company interactions, especially concerning SUNOO. This intense scrutiny often breeds inappropriate interpretations and unwarranted drama, with every glance, gesture, or word exchange subjected to dissection and psycho-analysis. I have heard about the concerns regarding his treatment within the company, which some attribute to discrimination and mistreatment. ENGENE Twitter tends to be loud, but loud does not always mean justified or right.

  
Sometimes the call-out culture around mistreatment becomes less about helping idols and more about scoring moral points or silencing others. ENHYPEN deserves to be celebrated for their talents and achievements—not just spotlighted as victims or martyrs. Positivity fuels fandom; constant negativity drains it.

Yes, there are real issues in the industry. But not every problem is absolute or easy to prove, and constantly assuming the worst wears everyone out. We need space for honest, balanced discussion.

Enhypenthoughts,1lbcyo5,2025-06-14 18:38:20,This is so true,"This comment was left by a bilingual Korean Engene just like me about prospective Korean fans who end up not entering the fandom because of how much hate international Engenes have for Korean fans.    

This Korean Engene’s exhaustion is palpable and I couldn’t agree more with what they’re saying and I really relate to how they’re feeling.  

For all international Engenes talk of needing more Korean fans, they sure make it hard to become one. 

This particular comment was found under a YT video uploaded by an international Engene and the comments section is flooded with hate and bitterness toward Korean Engenes. Even though the video is of a Chinese Engene (speaking Korean with a Chinese accent). The comments smack of superiority complex and derision and entitlement.  

It really baffles me how so many people in this fandom can’t seem to grasp how making chasms of divisions within the fandom by pointing fingers at Korean fans and treating them like the enemy at every opportunity works against collective Engene efforts to get Enhypen their deserved awards and recognition. Perpetuating hate towards Koreans and Korean fans has a direct and negative effect on Enhypen.  

Reddit Engenes tend to be a chill and reasonable lot most of the time, but there are still quite a few in the woodwork here on Reddit who perpetuate this hate and resentment towards Korean fans. These particular Engenes also very conveniently forget international fans are no better and are guilty of the same or similar behavior they accuse Korean fans of.   

All to say, acting superior toward another demographic is pointless and unproductive. People suck all across the board. Every nationality has their rotten apples. Let’s stop perpetuating hate and let’s please become a more focused, united, and productive fandom.  

Fact of the matter is, we could use more Korean fans. Please don’t engage in behavior that will scare off Korean fans looking to join the fandom. Let’s become a united front that is capable of getting Enhypen a long overdue MAMA daesang. Let’s become a united front that is capable of getting Enhypen consistent music show wins. 

I come from a fandom in which Korean fans and international fans work *incredibly* well together. Unity ***matters***. United we stand, divided we fall. ",128,47

I love Riki for how caring, talented, genuine, and interested he is about life and all the things. 

He's such an artist through and through. 

I'm close with my cousins who are his age and always call them my kids, so when I see Riki I feel a brotherly bond with him. I hope he knows, or gets to know, how cool and accomplished he is. And how proud he should be of himself.

The years 17-20 are super tough and beyond going through physical and emotional changes, the way you're perceived in society starts to change too. Not a teen anymore. But not really an adult yet. 

I want him to not feel the pressure to change ""back"" to how he ""used"" to be and wish him the best in the upcoming years. A lot of things change about yourself, in my opinion, in very positive ways in the 23-25 range. You begin to love yourself. And I hope he can look back and realize how damn cool and strong he is. 

I love my adoptive brother 😆🫶

Enhypenthoughts,1l9en2t,2025-06-12 07:38:41,Speculation about another album in 2025,"So recently I was catching up on some of Enhypen's variety show appearances, and on BYOB, Jake seemed to [stop himself from spoiling](https://youtu.be/q6skHPeb248?si=gx__ILDqWJp5J82p&t=395) that there would be two albums released this year. Along with the [Rolling Stone article](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bts-hybe-producers-pdogg-slow-rabbit-1235356716/) that confirms Armadillo is taking over as the lead producer for Enha, I thought it would be interesting to speculate about who might be taking part in the next album. 

Armadillo will likely once again be returning to produce the next album as their new lead producer after having produced 5 songs off of Desire: Unleash (Flashover, Bad Desire, Loose, Helium and Too Close). Around the time of Enhypen's Coachella performance, he made a post on his instagram with some songwriters and producers that could potentially appear on the album (however, this could also be for unrelated work or just a general songwriting camp that may not make it to the album). These writers include Lukas Costas (works w Corbyn Besson of Why Don't We and wrote Twisted Paradise by Yuta), Rence (wrote Dandelion by Jaehyun), Tony Ferrari (credits include Your Eyes Only and Chaconne, as well as 2 Baddies and Talk Saxy), and DCF (Ghosting by TXT, Wolf Type by &TEAM).

It seems like he also recently returned to LA sometime in May to continue work as according to another insta post Belift was renting studio time at West Lake Recording Studios (perhaps another songwriting camp). Based on interactions in the comments, it seems like some other writers on the project could include Ryan Curtis (Bills, Orange Flower, GGUM), heisenverb\_\_\_ and monotostereo (produced the Drunk-Dazed Coachella remix w Armadillo), and won (produced the ASEA intro and fan showcase intro). 

Hopefully this was a helpful roundup of information! I'm curious what other engenes think - do you think Enhypen will release another album this year? What do you think about Armadillo taking over as lead producer for Enhypen? If there is going to be another album, when do you think it will come out and what do you think it will sound like?",35,9

Enhypenthoughts,1l96vu4,2025-06-12 00:58:53,what is YOUR fav enha duo?,"**disclaimer this is not shipping the members romantically, this is not the place for that!!!**

I love them all, so if there are any ships you would like to talk about, please comment.

Here are some that came to mind:

**sungwon:**

(tbh probably my fav friendship in enha)

These two boys are such a comforting duo for me, they are so calm and sweet. Sunghoon's admiration for Jungwon is so adorable. They said they were the closest with each other pre-debut (when they were Big Hit trainees). I love that they have always been fond of each other. 

**jakewon:**

Lately, they have been showing how much they care for each other's presence. They have always been very close, and I've noticed that they almost always choose each other when asked about who they find comfort in, who they would call first, and so on. I just find them so cute I personally think they are one of the most clingy duos in ENHYPEN.

**yunki:**

They give so much brother vibes I love it. They are such a funny duo. I feel like you can see how much Ni-ki looks up to Jake (in a good way) he adores him so much. They are such a good match.

**jayke:**

Also, kinda brother vibes, but more like older (Jay) and younger (Jake) siblings. Jake is the younger brother Jay never had, and Jay brings out the annoying younger sibling in Jake. They adore each other so much, but they don't always show it, which I think makes their friendship stronger because they don't need to tell each other they just know.

I have many others I love, but these just came to mind.

Please comment your favorite

Enhypenthoughts,1l9djec,2025-06-12 06:33:06,On Enhypen and Deftones Aestheticization,"I've been following ENHYPEN for years, pretty much familiar with the fandom, members, and discography. I'm saying this as, you can say I am a Ni-Ki and Jay stan, but also a Deftones fan.

So today I came across a TikTok that used “Rosemary” by Deftones over a video of Ni-Ki from ENHYPEN, with the caption: “pls someone introduce Deftones to him.” One of the top comments said, “he’s so Deftones-coded.” And as a Deftones fan, that pissed me off. Not because I hate Ni-ki or Enhypen, but how the fandom seemed to appropriate elements of a subculture that is very much contradictory to Kpop.

Deftones is not something you just “code” someone as. Deftones is about pain, rebellion, alienation, abused trust, shattered dreams, heartbreak, and yeah sometimes horniness. But it’s not about being pretty or moody. It’s about being raw, fractured, out of place.

The very idea of aligning that with someone from the K-pop industry, which is an industry built on hyper-curated perfection, commercial fantasy, and surface-level vulnerability, feels sacrilegious. K-pop thrives on the ephemeral, eternal youth, flawless visuals, controlled personas. Monitored cameras. Having to look happy on variety shows. Never complain about your company or about your fans. To feed fans' delusions although. Similarly, it asks fans to bask in the glow of idols as objects of worship, not to question that worship or deconstruct it. There’s no room in that machine for the ugliness Deftones dares to explore. That would be too unpopular and does not work within the K-pop industry.

Take “Change (In the House of Flies)” for example. I interpret that song as a brutal commentary on objectification, like how Dorian Gray destroyed Sibyl Vane, and the toxic relationship we develop with what we once adored. We abuse the object of our adoration, and what we adore also turns us into a criminal, one who strips them bare with our eyes. Turning individual human being into objects, factory products, that is K-pop idols -- a product of the entertainment industry machinery. It’s not romantic. It’s not glamorous. It’s a slow, rotting unraveling of beauty. Show me one K-pop MV that actually reflects on what happens when the idol becomes ugly, when the fans’ love turns invasive, when the image collapses. Yeah you have Still Monster, Drunk Dazed, Fatal Trouble, WOWY, Jungwon covering Monster by Shawn Mendes, and yada yada. But theyre all about ""beautiful-looking monsters seeking redemption"", not actual monsters, like, say, people whom regular people will despise or look down at. Something that really makes you think, woe these idols are actually monsters and can be despicable. They're all packaged neatly and prettily, and dare not confront more directly and really tiuch the subject of toxic fan-idol relationship. The system doesn’t want catharsis, it wants controlled and aestheticized pain. 

And seriously—do these TikTok editors even listen to “Prince”? Those are brutal commentary on the superficiality of being on stage, of being worshipped by fans who fawn over you as part of a hysteria—not because they see you, but because they consume you. It’s the psychological death of the performer who gives everything, bleeds emotionally in public, and still ends up discarded when they make a mistake or lose their shine.

Also - alas, if only they absorb the lyrics of ""Around the Fur"" and ""Heart/Wires""! Again, criticism to vanity and unreachable hope/love (which is again, can be some form of antithesis to Kpop)

 The closest thing one can have with a ""Deftones-coded"" aesthetic is just skater aesthetic in California, with some elements of Lynchian surrealism, nu metal VHS, lofi, and unfilteredness, and some graphics that can turn violent and unsettling. Not just having the look of a bad boy. Look at Deftones members -- they may act as bad boys, but these faces are not K-pop pretty, they dont have polished look, and compared to idols, look like a bunch of homeless guys. But that's Deftones coded -- being a misfit. Just listen to the entire Adrenaline and Around the Fur album to grasp the idea of cathartic Deftones misfit.

I know I can’t stop people from turning Deftones into an aesthetic for content, but damn, it hurts to see something so deeply meaningful get hollowed out into a TikTok sound. We don’t listen to Deftones because it looks cool—we listen because it rips something out of.

If you wanna appreciate the beauty of Kpop idols, a more suiting Deftones song would be ""Minerva"". Or if you wanna romanticize your sacrifice for these idols, use ""RX Queen"" as the audio. ",1,9

Enhypenthoughts,1l7pcf7,2025-06-10 06:02:25,Voting and streaming,"I just saw  someone feeling guilty about not being able to vote so I wanted to say something. 

Let me just start off by saying that Enhypen are musicians and listening to their music automatically means that you’re supporting them so leave the whole real fan fake fan discussion out because as long as you wish them well and like their music, you’re a fan. 

Now I’ve been a kpop fan for years but I’ve only voted for MAMA before. This time I really wanted to vote and stream so I got stationhead and voting apps and it got so annoying because some of the apps are difficult to navigate and some are just glitchy etc. On top of all this there were a lot of hate tweets I’d constantly see online and it really got draining. 

So all I’m doing right now is not going online. I made a twitter account where I’m only following @encreasevt to help with polls whenever I’m bored and to know which polls are ongoing. I watch anime or dramas on my ipad and keep the ads playing on my phone to collect. 

Not having an active twitter account has saved me from hours of doomscrolling and seeing unnecessary guilt tripping or fanwars. Instead I can use that time to watch something fun while also voting. 

Nobody should be forcing themselves to vote or stream and I’m doing it out of my own will to see Enhypen get atleast a small return for all their efforts. If anyone’s on vacation or has a little time, you can just start with one or two voting apps and not all of them. Comment down below if you need any help and those in voting teams and groups can reply and help you out. 

Again, I’m only making this post to let people know that it doesn’t have to be stressful or overwhelming but I am not forcing anyone to go out of their way and contribute. Listen to yourself and don’t do anything against your will. 

Hope this comeback goes well 🍀 ",32,3

Enhypenthoughts,1l7bep6,2025-06-09 19:49:13,Target album update,"So I made a post two days ago about opening my album and having no photocards in it. I went yesterday to target to see if I could change it. Walk up to the counter I bought it at and the employee already had an annoyed stare. I already knew that they would be no help but I still tried. I explained the situation and she was like you can't do anything since its opened already and that there is no more albums left. She was so dismissive. This was confusing cuz I checked the website and it says items are allowed return open with exceptions which included music. I just left bc the situation was already stressful and I was lowkey holding back tears XD. 

Texted my friends afterwards and told them the situation and they said that i should go back bc I payed for it. I already had it in my mind when I went to just let it be if they said there was nothing they could do but after the rude employee I felt like I had to keep trying.

So today I called my target to speak with someone and to just confirm that there's nothing I could do. I explained my situation and told them about their return policy. They said yeah I could exchange as long as it was the same title. So I checked the website and they had 5 left so I went immediately. I got there, grabbed the album and walked to guest services. I was able to exchange it. 

This time I stayed and open it near the cashier and just my luck, it didn't have any inclusions except the poster again. Honestly it was so crazy it happened twice. I returned on line and she saw me and had a surpised face and was like what happened. I told her it didn't have the photocards. She was in disbelief and said I can go see if they have another one. 

I asked employee if they had more and they brought another one. Went back to guest services and the cashier checked it out again. She told me to open it to make sure that everything is there. I opened and thankfully the inclusion envelope was there. Thanked them and left. So grateful to the staff that were so helpful. 

Got home and pulled the maknae line!!! I'm so happyy :)

Whenever I go on twt, it’s just guilt tripping everywhere. You’re not an Engene if you’re not voting. A gf stan. A fake fan. Just here for clout. I have my own reasons as to why I can’t vote but I feel like no matter what, fans won’t validate any excuse or it has to be “somewhat acceptable” to them.

The last time I voted for Enhypen was for MAMA because I really wanted them to win a Daesang (which thankfully, they already did) and the voting process was easy. I’ve voted on a few polls before too. When I look at other voting processes on award shows or music shows, it just makes my head hurt. All the apps and accounts, time spent, things you have to collect, right times to vote. Polls have their own requirements too. It all feels so tedious and confusing.

I don’t stream their music vigorously whether that’s the MV or on Spotify. I only listen when I want to. I feel like I’m not doing enough as a fan and my guilt is eating me up. I would get attacked to hell if I say this on twt, and probably even here. Engenes’ first instinct is always to slam you in the face that you don’t care about the boys and how they’re doubting themselves.

I wish there was a way to vote easily for all these music shows but that’s probably never gonna happen. 

Edit: Haha nvm I had an adrenaline rush today and voted on several polls on twt. It was pretty easy and I figured it’s the least I could do for them. I’m now at peace. Conscience is cleared. Thanks everyone.",51,40

* He’s such a good-natured guy. He’s caring without even thinking about it. Just so considerate and extremely aware. 


* He loves music; not just as a consumer, but a creator. Not just as a doll or imitator, but as a musician and artist. 


* He has a bunch of different interests. The man cooks and tries to learn different languages, fashion, alcohols, perfumes. All very sensual things. It requires a lot of humility to want to try things and be the student. 


* He works hard and has a lot of drive being on a survival show. Even though he sleeps randomly, he’s not grumpy on a schedule. (Also I’m glad that the staff let him get rest instead of forcing him to stay up). I just don’t get any whiff of entitlement or manchild vibes. 


* He’s handsome with very masculine features (that jawline) and energy (serious but chill, sometimes goofy). It’s easy to see him as a man. He’s capable and straightforward af. 


* He’s positive and genuinely encouraging to fans. This mindset is hugely inspiring and super sweet.

Enhypenthoughts,1l7iwgm,2025-06-10 00:44:43,Enhypen's fan-service is getting out of control,"The recent spotify quiz for their album ""desire: unleash"" really made me uncomfortable. Especially being at the same age as them it made me even more weirded out😭 does someone else feel like that? 
Because personally I expected a quiz more like... less freaky and more about their music and them as artists? Because this album is really good and very versatile. I really can't imagine or understand what their management is thinking. 
Heavily sexualised, it just reminds me of teenager Justin Bieber. Although their fan service didn't get THAT LOW and hopefully never will. Nevertheless it's still concerning, doesn't matter if all of them are already adults or not.

Edit: since too many people think I'm criticizing the band for whatever reason? I clearly stated I don't really get what the management is thinking, therefore criticizing the company.
Plus I didn't really make it that serious like some people make it seem like, of course it was cringy and unserios. I was just weirded out, if y'all liked it then y'all are obviously the target group. This industry is a business after all, but this SPECIFIC service didn't speak to me at all, that's all there is. I was curious about others people opinions and pretty much saw a lot of normal criticism on tiktok and got the answers I expected here.
I really don't support heavily sexualised or suggestive fan service from any group, I stand on that firmly so that's the reason for my curiosity.
I won't really interact anymore with this post, but hopefully everything is clear now.

Enhypenthoughts,1l6np5q,2025-06-08 23:40:59,Enhypen - Desire: Unleash,"Helium

This song is great. I really like the chorus. And the extra helium at the end of chorus.

The last chorus when Jungwon and Jay were singing, the guitar was playing. I like that part where you could it hear it clearly. It added to the voices. It’s my favorite part out of the entire album.

It’s like Attention Please! and Scream. I love the beginning notes/chords and Jay’s guitar solo of Attention Please!


Outside

I really like verse 2 the most. I like having Jungwon and Jay go back and forth. It was really cool to hear.

Also during Jay’s part, the last line is a bit higher each time and I like that.

Verse 1 is fun with the beat.

I do like the chorus and when Niki sings ‘we be outside’.


Too close

I really like the piano notes. And having the beat drop on the second chorus.

I do wish that in the instrumental part, it switched up or something but still liked it.

It does sound like a song similar for the chorus. I still like the chorus though.


Flashover

It kinda sounds like it would be at a club/festival/dj type.

I like the verses and pre-chorus the most.

I did like the build up to the chorus. But then it kinda slowed down the beat. And it took the energy out of it. 

I think the chorus could be good if it didn’t have the huge build up to it. I still like the chorus and the beat. But it did feel like it needed something else.


Loose - korean ver.

It’s not necessary a bad song. Because I really like the original song. But it feels like a completely different song. With different lyrics. And it messes with my brain.

I do think that if this song was released first, I would like it just the same as english version.

And the fact that they didn’t keep Jay’s part as in the ‘so in 5,4,3,2,1, let’s let it’ is absolutely criminal. I really did like that part. 


Bad Desire (With or Without You)

It has potential to be a good song. But all I can think about is Mirrors by Justin Timberlake and I just Died in Your Arms by Cutting Crew. And it’s not bad, but I will continue to think about those songs each time I listen to it. I did like Mirrors, so the verses and pre-chrous was really good.


Overall

I did like half of the songs. But I think you have to listen to them again to make them really stick in your head. There not bad songs. There’s just something else that needs the extra push to be great. Because I feel like it kinda lacks something.

Not gonna lie, the visual and concept seemed totally different then what the songs sound like. Maybe the lyrics are what the concept was about, while the music itself was more about something else.

Enhypenthoughts,1l5nlg2,2025-06-07 17:33:50,ENHYPEN deserves more recognition in Korea — what’s holding them back?,"I’ve been following ENHYPEN since debut, and I genuinely believe they’re one of the most hard-working and conceptually strong groups of 4th gen. Their storytelling, music direction, performances, and even behind-the-scenes content have gotten stronger with every comeback. And internationally, they’ve built a loyal fanbase, topped album sales, and have been touring nonstop.

But what really puzzles me is their lack of recognition in Korea. Despite consistent efforts, chart performance on domestic platforms like Melon has been underwhelming. Even with promotions and appearances on Korean shows, they haven’t made the kind of impact you'd expect for a group of their caliber.

They’ve mentioned before that they want to be popular in their home country, and I can imagine it must be disheartening to work so hard and still feel unknown to the general public. Especially when they’ve been nonstop touring, recording, and even prepping for massive events like Coachella and their next album at the same time.

Do you think it’s the complexity of their concepts? Or maybe the Korean GP favors different styles right now? Would love to hear other people’s takes on this, because I feel like they deserve way more domestic love than they’re getting.",95,49

i'm a writer and i write letters to heeseung on twt! i also have a tg channel where i fangirl over him and post my observations of him and i'd love to broaden my audience and have more friends who share a similar heart!

  
or just any engenes who love to write, let's share our writings with each other :"")

  
here's a small paragraph i wrote for heeseung when asked why i love him, but i can share more (if you ask me to\~):

my enha bias is 희승 and i don’t think i’ll be able to put into words why, or how much he means to me. and i think a good way to start off would be to say i never understood the quote “if i loved you less, i might be able to talk about it more” until i met him. i often find myself at a loss for words when asked questions like why do you love him so much? i think a simple and short way to answer such a question would be that he helps me to ponder about love. i can still remember being so moved when he said love is quintessential, because something i observed about heeseung is he always believed that love had the power to move others. he’s never embarrassed to love wholeheartedly or talk about love, and he makes me feel unashamed of the love that resides in my heart. another thing is that, heeseung inspires me to try and step out of my comfort zone. just like now, with this message — i am unable to express myself well, but for him i will try penning a few words down. he’s someone that always encourages us to shy away from the negatives and focus on the positive changes we can make instead, and i think that’s really moving. his growth and journey as a person into someone that is attuned with his emotions, is something i deeply treasure. it is truly my privilege to be able to walk barefooted on his journey with him, that despite the hard pavement, he shows me that flowers do grow between the cracks and as time progresses, there will come a time where i step on soft cushioned grass. heeseung always believes that hardships are just a stepping stone to an even greater future, and for that i will admire him always. the way he takes misfortune in his stride, and turns uncertainty into opportunity. to end off this message, i would like to quote “with every prologue, there’s an epilogue. in every forest, there’s a green hue. everything that is me has a bit of you.” heeseung’s existence is deeply woven into my soul, and i can never put into mere words how much he means to me or impacted me. he is the one conscious choice i make everyday to love, and to not just love but love what is healthy for me. i found him at a point of time in my life where i felt nothing at all, and the most profound emotions were gifted to me through him. his gentle smile, his shy laughter, his tender heart that never ignores a fan’s heartfelt letter, the strength that he possesses amidst tumultuous times, his softness and how he never closes his heart to love despite it all. to say i have found my comfort and safe haven is an understatement, for in him i have found not just a tree in which the wild child sleeps, but also a person that motivates me to choose love despite it all and spurs me to become the best version of myself. i love heeseung and not just in a way that’s fleeting. i love him so i want to constantly better myself. i love him so i love the things he loves. i love him so i love the world around me. i love him so i endure hardships and grow from them. i love him so i love myself. i love him :”)

I'm not even Sunoo stan, I just randomly thought that that would be difficult for me if I were in his place

Really, I would like to see his new cover or vocal content (Heejay has two covers, for example), I would like to see him as ambassador of cosmetic brand. 

No offense but I don't understand his role in the group rn. They're pushing aegyo-pretty-boy agenda for him but I'm unsatisfied. Maybe he's not top3 in dancing but he's definitely top3 in singing but agency still pushing some other member for vocal line. It's not like some other member is not fitting for vocal line. It's just my dream about how Sunoo could have that place too

I love the other members as well! But you know, those people trolling him for being a lazy dancer, I just felt bad for him. He was a literal figure skater; how can he be a lazy dancer?

Enhypen just deserves a whole world for their hard work and consistency! They keep making my day, month and year better as I really can't live without good music lmao!",72,5
Enhypenthoughts,1l51jb4,2025-06-06 21:43:17,Album concepts,"It was actually really interesting to read the different opinions on the sub. It's a good break from other platforms where you could be put on the stake for saying that you didn't like a song or maybe it's production lol, and there's no freedom for constructive criticism.

But there was one opinion I didn't really understand which was about the way some engenes felt the concepts didn't go together? 

If you watch enhypen's podcast for Spotify today, Jake says quite a few times that the  lyrics need to be really understood to see how all the songs are just different expressions for desire. So it may not be cohesive genre wise , and some engenes probably wanted a classic sound like dark blood. But the songs by themselves, definitely make sense thematically. 

Also I can see that enhypen really wants to experiment and hey it's their career and their growth, they totally should. Imagine if Belift continued boxing them into this 'dark' genre , we would have never had a masterpiece like Helium by Jay for the album. It's totally valid to not like the album, for some of its sounds, but I also think continuously reiterating that the concepts don't go well together, or that we were probably misled, didn't make sense, atleast in my opinion.

I can talk about my favourite artist 
( yes it's not Enhypen) Florence and the Machine ( anyone😭?). Their albums, for example like Lungs (soft promo) are often a mix of genres too, from garage rock to soul, but to the listener it definitely communicates a central theme. 

I feel like this is what enhypen is going for here, and for the future, and I honestly think it's exciting idk.

This is not to come at anyone btw😭, besides this one thing, it was really cool to see our fandom embrace some constructive criticism, for example the song lengths etc. It's healthy!

i've been breaking my head with flashover, since they're all singing in falsetto it's been IMPOSSIBLE for me to recognize who's singing. did you guys manage to? i could recognize jay's voice on the second pre-chorus, and jungwon singing the second ""you should take this fire with me"" on the last verse - which, btw, it's the hardest part to recognize; why am i listening jake, sunghoon and sunoo in all verses 😭

also, who do you guys think really whispered the ""enhypen"" in bad desire? i believe it's almost settled it was jake, but my head only listens to jay's voice!!! also saw some engenes commenting it sounded like ni-ki or heeseung and i just gave up 

struggles aside, this album is FIRE. just a shame ALL songs are ridiculously short, but the quality is so good that it makes up to it. i just really hope they cut this trend on their next albuns. give me longer songs and MORE songs, please 😭 R:U being a full studio album with only eight songs was simply so sad ",11,20

“i worked on this album”

“my self-written song also is on the album”

“it’s my self-written song, ‘helium’”

jay put his heart on it, he also said “it’s even more meaningful because it’s a song where i can spread the wings of my dreams. through this song, i think you’ll be able to feel what kind of thoughts and concerns i, JAY of ENHYPEN, have about music” 

and isn’t it what music is about?? 

this post probably makes no sense at all but, anyways, i’m so proud of him, words can’t describe, and i really hope that the reaction that he has in the picture is a reaction and a feeling that he’ll have the rest of the days of his life. he deserves praises. he deserves this sm 🥹",314,17

Enhypenthoughts,1l4fsvj,2025-06-06 03:05:35,Desire : Unleash (Appreciation),"TW: this is an appreciation post about desire:unleash because the whole time im scrolling here, it's all disappointment and I can't bear seeing sad posts for such a classic album

While I respect everyone's shared thoughts and opinions regarding the album, I don't think it's right to say this isn't good of an album. Because it sounds very cohesive, exactly like how they present the concept, especially for Make version. It entirely sounds classy and very mysterious.

People here probably projected a different view that's why they expected something else like how they thought it's Dark Blood 2.0 but unfortunately Enha never said it's going to be DB version rather they emphasized how the title track's gonna sound different but more of a Criminal Love and Fatal Trouble sounding, which I agree that is very similar to Bad Desire.

Also, b-side tracks EATS!!!! I can't emphasize it more how I'm so excited to hear this live and see them perform this songs 😭 for new fans, you might feel the lacking for this songs which I respect because we all have different taste in music but if you have seen them perform live you'd really envision a performance for their songs with all these bangers! ++ I think try listening this album on Dolby Atmos if you have IOS device, because the quality of sounds there are MUCH MUCH BETTER compared to spotify

but to give you insights, I used to think like that when I first entered the fandom way back 2021, Dimension: Answer was my first comeback and I thought Blessed-Cursed is lacking but holy! I was completely in awe after seeing them perform it live! That's why after seeing them during manifesto tour, every song of them just hits entirely different to me because I know it'll EAT ON PERFORMANCE LEVEL STAGE.

After experiencing so many comebacks for Enha, and seeing them in every tour, I realized their songs are truly for big stages and performances, so now I'm just excited seeing everyone on concert going crazy for the Flashover beat drop, imagining just jumping and dancing by its electrifying sound! God, I can't wait to see it live!! I'm also envisioning Too Close where they go to their carts and go around the stage to go closer to fans and serenade them 😭 Ahhh, the way I can see Jake and Heeseung going to face an engene while serenading is making my heart scream!! Also, Helium?! This feels soooo shoutout and paranormal love to me. I can see this song as the encore of everything and while Jay riffs the guitar at the end, fireworks and colorful sparks would fire up on stage and Heeseung is at the background perfectly singing the siren sounds, I think I would cry!! 😭 and how could I forget Outside? this is such a banger, I could imagine everyone banging their heads and being into their hip hop side to feel this song and that Watch me and Skkkrr part? you know so damn well everyone gonna scream that part on live!!

Writing this makes me so excited for everything honestly, I love their songs, their music, the way they bring the song alive like it's breathing next to me and purely giving a soul to it makes me so happy to stan them as they are truly not just singers nor dancers but an artists who does their way to touch people's lives through singing and dancing. 

I love this comeback. I love this album. May this push Enhypen to greater heights and achieve more success in the future. 🥹❤️ Let's stream more!!

>Don't wanna take your golden light  
>Out in the world, you're just an angel

With how packed Enhypen's schedules are right now, it is really exhausting to perform 3 minutes long songs. 
Not saying it should be like that but it is just what I am thankful for in this period. Lately, I just found out that Enhypen went to mcountdown to prerecord their performance of Bad desire and Loose at 1:00 am, yes! 1:00 am and stayed there until 3:00 am, also, Gosh-knows wherever they went to prerecord other contents too before even holding a Fan showcase (also add the previous and upcoming live performances!). These past few months have been incredibly busy for them and singing a shout-out-like long songs must be exhausting and may be vocally damaging for them, singing 2 minutes max songs are unexpectedly a good compensation for that.

But as someone in entertainment/media i wish i could like ??? ask the company if they need some extra hands??? are they running out of money?? like the recent music video just feel so artifical (and almost low quality), from the poor CGI/vfx to the weird camera movements. 

moreover, the album designs (like the neon yellow and splatters) has NO correlation to the vibe of the songs in the album (a lot more pop-ish), NO correlation to the teaser concepts (like suits and business formal), and neither to the aesthetic in the MV (more dragon-ish wild flames).

i do like the MV aesthetic a lot and i wish they explored that theme more.... like a more hellish, fiery, dragons and such (was digging that ofc!!! and the title track is really good). But songs like ""Loose"" just don't.... fit?? its giving denim, pop, chill. and then of course the albums being saturated blue and yellows and having thick basic font doesn't match either.

im gonna be so honest i'm just disappointed that the creative team didn't pull through. enha is really talented but aghhhhh like does the belift creative team not moodboard together??? i have a feeling they outsource everything from different people with different visions for the album, resulting in this inconsistency.

i think dark blood was just really peak because everything from the songs, outfits, mvs, concepts, etc. were really consistent with a specific vibe.

during your first couple of listens, are there any parts of the songs that you were immediately obsessed with? for me, it is definitely the way sunghoon sings ""beautiful fire"" in the second chorus. it's so whiny and throaty and the little crack in his voice perfectly captures the intensity of their yearning for their lover. normally songs have really polished vocals but this little vocal imperfection adds so much more emotion to this part of the song.",30,18

Enhypenthoughts,1l3z0e1,2025-06-05 15:19:52,I played enhypen escape here's a guide: (i guess),"Here's the game link: [https://enhypenescape.com/pc/](https://enhypenescape.com/pc/)  or type enhypen escape on google

You click on the green box get the key and click on the door make sure to click those glowing paper things click on the door and you're outshould look smth like ts there are puzzles if you want to find the code yourself but i used 0605 (the release date) and the case code is 0209 (jungwon's birthday) and there'a lot to explore and im not gonna spoil that ;)

https://preview.redd.it/rs0o4qw5z35f1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e8f07c9539859cbe57aa39917816952de2cec64

You go to that green sign, collect the torch and type 0605 on the code lock, you go out you may see another door you go in there  use the torch and find a crowbar and you go to another door INSIDE the room and you use the crowbar to get the album :D

then you go out go to the lever

the order is: 1st lever,3rd lever,2nd lever, 4th lever

it should open and you use the torch

you can find the access cards IF you want too  that are glowing but NOT the glowing papers but if you go to the green room it will say thats NOT the escape

the escape's on the right in green

it will say: Do you have desire? you click on yes and you escape!!

It should look like this if you didnt show the access cards and went to the red door on the left

but if you did you basically get caught  and lost and you went to the red door it should show a cutscene then this

Enhypenthoughts,1l3r1tz,2025-06-05 07:14:20,DESIRE:UNLEASH REACTION,"ok to start.. this is my first comeback so i’ve been waiting for this since coachella 😭with that being said.. it took me 10 minutes to get past the first 2 songs because I kept replaying them.

flashover. my goodness where do i start. the edm vibes are so good and it fits them really well which isn’t surprising tbh. it went well with drunk dazed so them actually setting out to do that type of song wasn’t gonna be anything but good in my opinion lmao. 

i don’t think i have the words to describe how good bad desire is. to start sim jaeyun whispering enhypen in the beginning nearly took me out before they even got started. the line distribution is so good like you can clearly tell who’s singing which parts. it’s really well produced too. actually all the songs are. 

outside. whew outside. now i knew it was along the hip hop line but did i think they would be full blown rapping?? absolutely not but i was PLEASANTLY surprised. the beat is crazy too (i’ll probably say this a few more times. i’m a sucker for a good beat lmao) i can’t wait to see them perform this. 

loose (korean ver.). i didn’t think i would like it just because i’m used to the english version but idk why i thought that lmao. they did a good job of keeping the original vibe of the song (as usual) even though its in a different language. i’ll probably still listen to the english version tho just because i’m used to it and it’s easy for me to sing along. at least until i’m fluent in korean 🫡

by the time I got to helium I was tearing up a lil because it hit me that it was produced by mr. park jongseong. he did an amazing job. you can tell he produced it. its exactly his style but still enha. i’m so proud of him man😭 i know they’re gonna have fun performing it. 

too close. too close is THAT girl. the beat switch?? the harmonies?? its so well produced and they sound amazing. its so fun too. like the type of song you dance around your room to. the production is so nasty i can’t get over it. they cooked fr. 

bad desire (english ver.) OH HELL YEA. i didn’t think it was possible to love it more than i already did but here we are. “what if I told ya that I want ya? but I see your heart is pure” like?? its exactly what i said about the korean version of loose. energy/vibe is still there just in another language. personally i feel like the english and korean versions of bad desire will blow up at the same time. they’re both fantastic. 

this ended up being longer than i thought because i wasn’t gonna do each song individually at first, but they were too good not too. overall its very well produced and you can tell they’ve reached a new level as artists. the line distribution throughout the whole thing was so good. i’m so proud of them. you can really tell they took the time to learn new techniques to help them develop their skills. 

this will surely be on repeat for the next month which is good because now a new countdown for the tour begins 🥳",20,3

Today the pre orders will close at KST time. Then the day sales will start when album will release tomorrow. Total of pre orders and day sales will be counted for total album sales of Desire Unleash album ✨. So, whoever have not yet pre-ordered can still preorder and also who have been waiting for release of the album, the day sales starts tomorrow ✨✨!!
We have to stream Bad Desire MV on YouTube and I've heard that we cannot make playlist in the first 24 hours so we have to stream the MV manually. We should also refrain from using emojis as they cut the view count. The target of MV views for first 24 hours is 15 million. 🥰🥰
Spotify streaming can be done easily as we have pre saved it already. We are currently at no 3 on the K-pop countdown chart on Spotify pre-save. We can also stream playlists, and the album should be streamed at first in the order it's released. The target for Spotify streams are at least 2 million streams of all songs and MV streaming target is similar to YouTube target. ☺️☺️
The premium users can stream on Stationhead and make jams and listening party as well. This will help in streaming a lot. 
Voting for M Countdown Stage will be on ""Mnet+"" app, for Ikigayo Stage ""Linc and Higher app"" , for Music Bank ""All-Chart app"".

Even if in case, Enhypen x Chase Atlantic becomes possible, will we be getting a collab for a b-side like BTHB, with any solo singers like Shawn Mendes, Charlie Puth, Benson Boone or a female solo singer, etc.... or an alt-music band like LSFRM x JUNGLE. ",17,3

Enhypenthoughts,1l1gxg5,2025-06-02 14:37:42,i had a dream jungwon 💀,"this isn’t even a joke i was so sad both in the dream and when i woke up. 

The dream:
i was on holiday but then all of a sudden i was in a large hall with my friends when someone announced that Enhypen had come to perform(mind you im not even in asia, Usa or europe so this was unexpected) so i was so excited, my friends not so much because they only know Enha coz of me. Right before they came on stage though, the same person announced that Jungwon had passed that morning but no further details. i was literally shaken to my core and im not kidding i couldn’t breathe for a bit. my friend had to calm me down but it didn’t work. 

then Enha came on and i was standing right by the stage in the hall. i was searching for jungwon on that stage but he literally wasn’t there💔 they started performing Bite me but you could tell none of the members wanted to be there. like they had energy in their dancing but their eyes were red and they kept messing up the formation (they were doing an ot6 ver) and their vocals just weren’t their best. 

I was so sad the whole performance and was crying so much that when their performance was over Sunghoon came up to me and i was the only one in that hall crying so he thanked me for being such a devoted engene and that we’ll get through this together (i don’t know how that was supposed to happen they were going back to korea). he hugged me and thanked me again and i did the same then i woke up. 

I was literally so sad when i woke up i felt like crying so i went online and just looked at edits of jungwon to make myself feel better. 

The reason im posting this is because i have no one to talk about this with and am i a weirdo for dreaming about this? i never try to look into dreams but i just wanna know if anyone thinks there’s some sort of meaning behind it or im just watching to much enha content😭",57,34

Which talks abt the tour successes of Seventeen, Ateez, Jhope, TXT and ENHYPEN..I read thru it and still don't know much.. but it talked abt ticket sales and how kpop is now a global phenomenon and all the other stuff..(take a look thru it if ur interested)
It is a good article but the problem is...
The enhypen picture that was used in the article does not include niki as he was behind jay in the performance, they shld have gotten a picture with niki also seen properly but I guess this is kinda forgivable, but they didn't even include niki's name in the article, that is absolutely disrespectful..
This is not the first time billboard made a mistake regarding enhypen, a while ago after enchella, they released an article abt the top performances including enha and had nothing but praise for them, but there was smth wrong, it was a line which said ""enhypen played their hit song walk the line in coachella"".. which is clearly not true, i posted abt it on reddit and ppl said they prolly mistook future perfect(pass the mic) for walk the line... And it was swept under the rug cuz it was minor, but this is actually disrespectful 
not having him in the frame for the pic could be forgivable but comeon not even including his name, that is NOT okay, niki worked hard to be in this grp and deserves all the recognition, ALL the members need to be respected!!!

mine was for sure heeseung. i’m not sure why since i tend to like the more introverted members (my ult is sunghoon lol) but for some reason i just could NOT figure him out. maybe it’s because he had so many expectations due to his reputation in iland and set the bar so high that he seemed a bit untouchable to me. after seeing more of his personal lives and really focusing on him as a person, i found myself loving him just as much as the others and now he’s one of my top 3!! do you guys have similar experiences?

As I'm currently in the midst of playing ads and pretty bored, I decided to rank the apps with the criteria only concerning the collection of points with ads, because I can! 

1. Linc: My beloved! 🤞 Very easy, doesn't bug a lot, the wait is very short, the ads aren't bothersome so it passes by really fast. Lovely layout.

2. Mubeat: Fine! 🥸 No time between ads, sometimes bugs.

3. Mnet Plus: Not bad but not good! 🫠 Time between ads is short, sometimes bugs, the ads are pretty annoying and I have to click like three times to get out, some also redirect me and some last ages to finish.

4. Idol Champ: Mood swings! 😦 Nice roulette, the wait is pretty random at times,, the roulette always gives 2 or 4, but the occasional 8 is exciting, like a taste of success. Yesterday the roulette bugged and I couldn't spin it. The ads are similiar to Mnet Plus, too.

5. Higher: Bane of my existence! 🤢 Takes agesssssss to finish, the ads are long, the good side is that there are 50 chances, but like, I have to wait a minute every 3 to 5 ads, the ads are like Mnet Plus, and it takes some time to load the ads, sometimes I click and leave it to play and the ad doesn't play, so I have to click it a few times.

Didn't actually take into account how much weight the points collected have because I saw on the guide that I need like 2000 rubies from Higher and my blood pressure spiked, but yeah, this is it. 

For tips on actually doing this daily, I use the apps on my tablet while I read comics or watch social media on my phone before I go to bed, so I just have to be checking in to click on the ad, closing the ad and monitoring the waiting time between ads.

And talking about this game, it freaking scared me 😂. Sure there were no jumpscares, but I had my volume on max, not only the game looked creepy (very fitting for a vampire theme) but the alarm when I pulled the wrong levers in order made me flinch. I probably would have gotten a heart attack if they decided to include the desire monster from the trailer to jumpscare us 😂.

Enhypenthoughts,1kuyb48,2025-05-25 11:13:13,So glad I found my ult group,"I’ve been a kpop fan since 2017 but even though I liked a lot of groups genuinely, I’d always end up being a lowkey solo stan as I’d only keep up with one or two members. I had no negative feelings for other members but I just didn’t seem to care enough. Few years later there was another group I thought was my ult but I was always unhappy with some of the music and almost everything related to them such as concepts, styling, etc. 

I’m so glad I finally found enhypen! I did watch Iland in realtime and voted but I waited until they released some music to fully stan them and I was so pleasantly surprised. Right now I can talk about every single thing about them that feels so right to me and fits all my taste preferences. I also love all 7 members equally and watch every solo project and live they release. I never thought I’d find a group like that. 

Songs like chaconne, sacrifice, mixed up, moonstruck, your eyes only, fate, foreshadow, mortal, blind, criminal love, scream, fatal trouble and oh my god so many of them sound so original and beautiful to me. I’m well aware that there might be similar songs somewhere but I’ve never heard anything remotely close to chaconne ever. I personally love dark r&b and trap and the way they made it sound so regal and elegant is remarkable. I have a playlist of every single song of theirs and even though I’ve never consciously streamed their music for stats, I end up streaming their entire discography everyday as if I was getting paid to do so. 

I absolutely love the members and really connect with their humor and personalities. I also love how much effort they put into fanservice and fan communication to the point where I was worried why Jungwon was live so many times this one particular month and if something was wrong with him 😭 He’s just so sincere as an idol. They’re all so talented. 

All in all I think their team understands them really well and knows exactly how to make them seem more attractive and cool. All of their choreographies, songs, costumes, set designs are made tastefully with their concept and the member’s images in mind which gives them a really cohesive brand. I love anime and of course the group I like the most just so happens to have a whole webtoon and soon to come anime that has such a good art style. I often feel sad because it feels like their effort isn’t giving them enough returns and they aren’t getting as much recognition as they deserve but I think kpop has ruined my brain and they’re actually quite successful and hopefully making a lot of money. Its unfortunate that they might not be the biggest boygroup ever but as long as they keep doing what they’ve always done, the reward will come to them in one form or another. 

Sorry for that ginormous essay full of glazing I just needed a place to let it all out. ",97,10
Enhypenthoughts,1kvduq8,2025-05-25 23:40:32,Talking about Enha's LA Concert (at the bmo),"Possibility of a second date being added to Enha's stop in LA? 

I was looking at the bmo schedule and theres six available days before the 16th , and 4 days after. Not too sure about soccer season changing up the schedule, but going off from Ateez dates the week before they have both friday and saturday dates. So I'm predicting there is the possibility left open for a second show to be added , would have to be the 15th or any day after the 16th (bc 13th they're in htx). 
Also I don't remember exactly what the days in between were, but when their manifesto tour was announced ticketing for day 1 was days apart from ticketing for day 2 (around a month?). Usually scheduling ticket drops for a 2 day stop happens day of ticketing or the next 2 days after ticketing goes live. It would be really odd if the company add a second enha date over 1-2 months after ticketing went live, but i'm delusional and holding onto some hope. 😪 
Any opinions? ",9,7

Also, I hope people would appreciate Sunoo's vocal tone more. I personally think it gives additional flavor to Enha's songs. Some of their songs that I consider my favorites because it highlighted his vocals would be Chaconne, Still Monster, I Need the Light, and Bite Me. His riffs and the way he harmonizes with the members is so beautiful!

I wish fans would see him way past the shipping or the 'sassiness'. He also has such a unique and strong mindset. There's no doubt he gets a lot of negative comments, but his outlook in life is worth noting for. His recent answers during magazine interviews also showcases his growth and maturity as an individual and as a member, I actually found it impressive.

They debuted with a pre-planned image and musical style and it kept evolving every comeback that fits more with the members' actual identity as a group.


Idk if anyone else agrees with me, but Enhypen's identity goes beyond kpop. Their group dynamic, aesthetic, presence, and music taste never reminded me of a typical kpop group. Even their cover songs and dance covers appeal to a wider reach beyond kpop. They break their own genre limitations and make music that resonates beyond Korea.


I'm a Dark Blood enthusiast too but I think Desire: Unleashed is closer to who they actually are now. They've had a dark image for most of their careers and I think they're transitioning to show how confident and empowered they've become. They've really matured into adults with their own artistic sense.


As Sunoo said, this album can be described as ""Enhypen"". The songs also sound like the songs they'd play on Weverse Live because it aligns with their taste lol. I can see why they're so proud of this album and call it their best one yet.

I honestly feel like a lot of fans assumed Sunoo was getting plenty of votes anyway, so they focused on voting for other trainees instead. But I’m not entirely sure how the voting system worked back then. What's your take on this?

(Aaalso, with K being a constant I-LANDer and a top contender, it must’ve been tough for Sunoo to be chosen over him.

Enhypenthoughts,1kr1a62,2025-05-20 12:14:25,ranting about kpop stans and praising Enha's stance in their art (very very long rant),"In Twitter, where I mainly lurk around, engenes there are doing great in fighting back while blocking and reporting other's attempt in making a hate train like in 2022. Currently though, something about enha's art is being discussed. The situation begins when SM deleted a concept picture of Irene&Seulgi's upcoming comeback.  That picture is of an oyster: 

[the said oyster](https://preview.redd.it/f1zbaozl7w1f1.jpg?width=1638&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e24116c5ed7b503d50acfcb3d02416701c38ae30)

nothing wrong right? Especially with the more seductive concept the the duo currently teasing for this comeback, the oyster is just that: a symbol of femininity and sexuality and it plays well with the other pictures like this:

Quite an appealing concept right? And it shows that the duo is more than ready to show a stronger and seductive femininity. The question is: why was enha in this situation when the fandoms are different, the companies aren't the same and the concepts are just under the same umbrella? Well a normal tweet from an engene broke their last straw:

Some of the tweets:

If you want to see the smack downs engenes gave them, here is the link of the tweet : [https://x.com/hypersunova/status/1923413292422218124](https://x.com/hypersunova/status/1923413292422218124) . Just go to the quotes, you will see them there.

Do you think the engenes reaction is an overreaction? No, because after the enchella, kpop fans have been trying to bring down whatever hype Enha had, from the time old fatphobic comments, to akagaes to saying the n-word, to comparing achievements, Twitter engenes have been busy in this longass smackdown. Should have they report and blocked instead? Yes they should have, but with the sheer amount of tweets, it felt easier for them to fight fire with fire, especially that almost all of kpop stans are just spewing misinformation in attempt to bury Enha in a hate train. Their insecure asses can't stand the rapid growth of the boys that they are trying to divert our attention elsewhere, with little to no success, if we compare our pre-comeback streams and sales this year.

Now back to the situation, many kpop stans feel that it is double standards that SM deleted the oyster picture when Enha has posted these pictures, the reason why Asian and those currently in Asia engenes had to sleep at 2 am of:

....my heart still hasn't recovered... i may not survive the comeback.......

Anyways, the reaction of the majority of engenes is that dog in the fire ""This is fine"" and lots and lots of screaming. This positive reaction led to some of those ""feminists"" complain about how this is a primary case of double standards, that enha can show BDSM while I&S had to remove the oyster. Which many engenes reacted like this: ???????????.  

They want to know the reason? Here. First of all, stop colluding us into making us look like we asked SM to delete that pic. The audience, the fanbase and the company are so separated that the only connection we have is the concepts' vibe which are both seductive and sexy. That's the company's problem and THEIR problem. That's the second reason, their company is so sensitive to their korean fanbase that even the slightest complaint is taken more seriously than the majority of their international fandom. Why they don't take that into court? That's also their third reason, they know that they have no voice with SM while the majority of our fanbase has also been international, so kr voices aren't that heavy. So where did their frustrations take them? To kpop stans' most popular punching bag, enha. Wow, kapal ng mukha. Akala ba nila we are still in 2022, rookie group with rookie stans, still cringing under one of the worst hate trains I ever witness, I had to go into hiatus. 

Nevertheless, their tweets didn't really convey ""I&S shouldn't have gotten hate?"", it's "" Why didn't Enha got hate as well?"" making it feel that we should have also made it a problem.

Well, let's take a look at DARK BLOOD. The choreography with female dancers on their title track, Bite Me, caused the k-engenes to fall apart. Truck after truck, they persistently demanded for the dancers to be removed while international engenes made the counter, asking to them to not give into their demands. Now, it may look like that k-engenes won right? But Bite Me was promoted in shows for the full two weeks with the dancers. They didn't give up on the original choreo just to appease their k-fanbase, instead promoting them for the whole period of the title track. The first time we see them perform the solo version was in the big award stages, where we can assume that the contract of the female dancers were just for the Bite Me promotions and bring them up for the big stages for just one song is unnecessary, so they had the solo version. It recently made me realize, how their concepts cannot be changed too willy nilly and doesn't care about the opinions of other.

Enhypen and how their company deals with them in reality is so left to be desired but the stance on enha's whole concept is astounding. The creativity, the vision, how the imagery of enha lies in vampirism but they're not sticking to one-dimensional concepts. How it still connects to their lore while giving out so much variety, changing every comeback, making us not tired, keeping us wanting for more. How they are boldly moving their own line, not following a set path, and making it clear that their art, their vision, their creation is here for a long run, especially when the members are showing that they are wanting to be involved more with their music, making it more them. The decisiveness on how the story should be told, may it be traditional vampire, modern creatures or unyielding monsters makes it exciting to wait for it come to life.

Stanning Enhypen may not be for the weak, with how kpop stans' hate boner always keeping us cautious, but it is worth the music, the personality, the art and the people to be fans of and to continue walking besides their line.",52,14

Enhypenthoughts,1kr6uaq,2025-05-20 16:52:33,D:U timeline,"I’ve been trying to piece together the timeline of their lore and how desire:unleashed fits in. now that we see more of the laboratory/prisoner photos, this is what I think. and tbh I haven’t rewatched older cinemas, so this is just from memory.

in r:u cinema, they are being hunting, but go back into the town to get sooya (or chloe?). they get pulled over and have to fight out. at this point, i am guessing they get captured

this takes us to the laboratory. once captured, they are locked up and tested on. this makes them snap (ripper style, a la vampire diaries), and leads them to go crazy. so now they are fueled by their desire for blood, and are attacking people (like jimmy). their pure love for chloe/sooya might also be transformed at this point into desire and bloodlust. in tandem. 

i’m not quite sure how they actually got on the show, any ideas there? because obviously in r:u vampires were bad and hunted. not shown on tv. 

so in my mind, d:u is chronologically after r:u, maybe a few years? a decade?

They’re having a comeback on June 5, then performing at WTL Bangkok on June 21, and just one week later, they’ll be at japan for their WTL Summer Edition. Given how tight their timeline is, do you think they’ll still be able to promote the title track for more than two weeks on music shows? Or will they likely keep it short, like they’ve done during previous comebacks when they were also busy?

Also, do you think they’ll have time to promote a follow-up track after their concerts, maybe for just a week or so each? Or will they wrap up their promotions early and shift straight to preparing for the Summer Edition instead?",15,4

Enhypenthoughts,1kqva99,2025-05-20 05:33:25,Questions on buying albums,"Hello, I am an engene that hasnt bought a single album of enha as I am still an unemployed graduating student readying herself for the board exams. I feel a bit down when I realize that I am an engene that voted in I-LAND but hasn't have a single album. Still, I wanted to ask some questions on the albums because I need to prepare myself for the cost when I do have my own income and lessen the mistake for buying them for the first time. (I will be 🌟manifesting🌟 being a working professional this year) I was just scrolling down the weverse shop to see the prices of each album but what is showcase and video call on the preorders of desire: unleash? Is that like a raffle ticket in winning a video call with enha?? What about showcase? Isnt it performed after the releash of the album on the same day? So how can you go to the showcase? Would you be eligible right now and the raffle ticket for that is available when you buy the album with showcase even when the album isn't shipped yet? 

I am curious because if they release an album  next year, I need to know what should I buy. Like I know sets are too freaking expensive so should I just buy one and buy the ones I like the concept the most at those who bulk buy from weverse? Or just buy a set of their previous album every year with the new album sets that they release that year? 

Btw, I don't get about the engene set and set album. Is the engene set the set album with an engene version? So the engene set is 3-4 albums? Do they also restock the past albums on weverse shop or do I have to buy in a physical kpop shop (Does the PH have one? Can you recommend which shop?)

Though buying of previous albums would be set back for buying the future ones because you know money doesnt rain so I will be saving to buy them in tandem once I am secure enough.",13,4

Enhypenthoughts,1kq4a0z,2025-05-19 07:47:16,the party is over… and i can’t get over fate plus tour in seoul,"This post will be corny af but I’ve been to enhypen’s last day of FATE+ tour concert in Seoul and I don’t think I’ll ever get over it.

I believe it’s kind of a consensus within the fandom that this was one of their most emotionally charged concerts ever and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to put into words what the energy was like in the venue that evening. Sunghoon’s ment and tears were a catalyst but I think maybe the lingering energy previously there was also a catalyst for his outburst.

Just as an example I had one of the most odd experiences in my life when, during one of the members’ ment, I caught myself replying to their interactions with the audience in Korean along the crowd. I can’t understand much less speak the language and yet there I was naturally doing it, as if automatically replying in my mother tongue, as if their message had slipped through consciousness and just landed flat where I could touch the meaning with bare hands.

Now, as much as I know I was probably just unconsciously following the crowd, I can’t not romanticize how immersed I was in that moment and atmosphere that it literally felt like the language barrier had completely vanished, to the point of reading the translation to their speeches later on and feeling like just revisiting what I had already heard earlier.

That’s just how powerful this almost-4-hour-long concert was, and what made me realize once again how much sincerity enhypen carries in everything they touch or anywhere they step, and the way they convey it makes it clear they are messengers for the power of art and passion.

Just a really, really great group!

But I genuinely think the whole movement to b***ott ENHYPEN because of their brand deals is stupid as hell. People are acting like the members are personally endorsing war crimes when they’re just fulfilling contract obligations as idols under a company. These decisions are not always theirs to make.

What really gets me though is the double standard. The same people who are calling out ENHYPEN and trying to cancel them are doing it all on Twitter. Like hello? Twitter is owned by Elon Musk. The same Elon Musk who is a MAGA supporter and an open Zionist. But somehow that’s not a problem. You’ll keep using his platform every single day while claiming to be so morally righteous.

It’s all so black and white for these people. There’s no room for nuance or understanding of how the industry works. They ignore the systems in place and just go straight for performative outrage. It’s selective activism at its finest. B***ott brands if you want. That’s valid. But attacking artists who have limited control over these things while using platforms owned by people with the same values you claim to be fighting against? That’s hypocrisy.

Btw, I am not worried for the sales or the music or the impact this album will bring upon us. I am just a tiny bit concerned with the concept of Mine. Because kpop fans are quite shallow, they will see this concept and say enhypen is satanic when it is absolutely not true. Vampirism is always going to be connected with christianity and saying things to undermine the lore of what enhypen is based on when they themselves don't understand the connection. Yes, vampires are also considered demons in some media but if they want to get pedantic, vampires are folklore, they dont exist in the Bible. IT'S FICTION PEOPLE! Vampires are literally a man made creation, a monster of that night where they feast upon human blood. Satanism is the relegion or belief that focuses in the worship of the devil. Do they look like they are promoting the worship of satan? Where do you base that?? The red color scheme?? That ain't satanism. Sure, we can say that the crown of thorns is a bit sketchy but if you look closer on what that means, the crown of thorns represents sacrifice and suffering which the concept is based on one of their songs (Sacrifice (Eat Me Up)).

Of course, it's going to look evil BECAUSE THIS CONCEPT'S (MINE) ENVIRONMENT IS THEM BEING IN LITERAL HELL/UNDERWORLD, TRYING TO DEFY FATE. They are sinners and monsters AND THAT IS THE POINT BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE CONCEPT IS THAT THEY ARE FUCKING VAMPIRES!!! 

Okay, I let that out. If I am wrong, I am sorry but I just based this on my knowledge on the Bible and what I searched on Google. I just don't want them to accuse enha of satanism point blank just to get the boys a hate train. How ironic, to accuse of sin when they themselves aren't sinless.

My daughter is big kpop girlie, she has a very eventful summer planned (she calls it hot kpop girl summer) because I'm taking her to see Stray Kids in June, Blackpink in July (she's seen them twice before) and Enhypen ofc in August, took her to see BabyMonster back in February and LAWD I hope TXT isn't touring any time soon cause no more, my poor wallet. We're NYC based.  ANYWAYS, I'm here because we recently watched I-Land together, she'd been wanting to watch it for a while but she read on tiktok that it was sad and whatnot so she'd been avoiding it, I said I'd watch it with her and maaaan oh maaan, what a show, what a whirlwind. That show was insane and I've watched a lot of reality TV in my day, ya'll. 

So many moments were so unhinged but then a good few were actually so funny?? What an odd experience, lmao. My daughter's bias is Heeseung and when they were doing their little video concepts at the end to appeal to last minute voters and his concept was 'I'm a popular guy at school and I'm singing to one girl only' or whatever it was, she folded so fast, LMFSKSKS. That man was unhinged---in a good way---from the beginning and it's so funny to me. 

Their music is actually so good like my daughter's been gatekeeping, why are all of their songs bops. Fatal Trouble supremacy and both my daughter and I would give anything for Fate to have been a full fledged song, the robbery. 

Super long rambling cut short, her birthday is coming up in July and looking for any recs of things to get her, for any of the groups I mentioned above, she only has like two albums of each group and I guess I just don't know where to start. Also if anyone lives in NYC, any recs of places to shop at? I work near 34th Street Herald Square so I do have K-town right near by, I've been to Koryo Books but are there other places I should go to? My little girlie has the worsttt luck with photocards, she has never pulled her bias ever except Rosé in the lightstick box and she did get photocards in her solo album when she got it for Christmas, but she's never pulled a Hyunjin or Heeseung, nor her bias from TXT who's name I do not know.

as for the album as a whole, i know fs that at least one or two songs will play into their lore the way criminal love and lucifer had.>! ngl hoping there's one about a painful emotional happy reunion. maybe it'll feed my delulu ass because i've been wondering if there'd ever be a defying-life-and-death reunion between a certain pair of characters during children of vamfield (vammy whammy lmao). one was taken away way too soon, while dreaming about moving far away from the town one day. hint: green bow.!< 

i have a feeling that the title track if not the whole album in general will be a weird but oh-so-fitting mix romance untold, dark blood, with a sprinkle of orange blood. which, in the beginning of what is summer for most people, would turn out interesting bc i would consider that more of an autumn fit release but anyways guys.

 so guess away, and don't be surprised if what they actually give us is the complete opposite of what you thought--you can never tell with enhypen. ",28,10

Enhypenthoughts,1knihfw,2025-05-15 22:28:39,Times you recognized a voice vs. times you didn't,"Now that we have officially begun comeback season, and are getting new music soon, I wanted to ask about random times you recognized a member's voice or times you didn't when a song just came out and didn't have performances, when you were newer to their voices, or just for whatever reason!

I have two with Sunoo where I recognized him, when the XO TikTok came out and they did the chrous dance with Heeseung at the center, but I was so excited to identify Sunoo's voice in that autotuned chorus I immediately went to my friends and swore that he got a main chorus part and was incredibly happy, just waiting for double confirmation from the MV and the performances.

The other is when Teeth came out, and during the slow-mo part, I immediately was like 'that's Sunoo' based on his pronunciation of 'Tasty', lol.

A time a didn't though, is this embarrasing story of me fusing Sunghoon and Jay's voices in the chorus for Chaconne. Like, I genuinely thought Sunghoon sang the whole run of the second part of the chorus in the first chorus, even after hearing him sing Jay's part in the second chorus. It was only after I thought that it wouldn't make any sense for the second chorus to be split four-ways and the first three-ways that I got it. ",15,9

he's sweet but also it feels like he has a hidden character, more serious and reserved, that he is trying to show more now. its so interesting to see the image change. he is lot less loud and much quieter than i remember him to be. he reminds me so much of wonwoo, which is probably why i am so drawn to him. he's intelligent but in a quiet way, really introspective and emotional , loves photography and the small , precious moments in life like stars in the sky. his duality is just insane and its always a struggle because one day hes cute and the next he's so different! but I remember that was supposed to be his iland charm, and it feels like he is going back to that quiet but steady determination of those iland days, with his haircut and general demenour. 

someone like jungwon has stayed pretty consistent from what I can see, pretty much the same personality. i think sunoo is the same but he's just so hard to read! under his aegyo (which is changing now as he does less), i honestly struggle with him. but of course he is such a good performer and singer as he was.",138,12

I'm personally not a fan of grandiose display of affections and I like subtle but consistent showing of love and concern and I feel like that's what Ni-ki does.

His concern is shown in a way that is quiet, the ""it's not a big deal, this is normal to me"" type of way. One sometimes has to pay close attention to see it. It's like it's woven in his day-to-day life. Something he does as normal as breathing. It's something that you get used to over time because it's done constantly.

I know that he has matured and became cooler, he's not as rowdy or as mischievous as before, but this thing about him... I don't think it has changed at all.

Enhypenthoughts,1kf8j5x,2025-05-05 12:45:36,Theories on Heeseung as an artist,"I'm so excited for Heeseung's solo project one day. His ringtone is amazing and it feels like a preview to his taste and style. We're all guessing he'll have a solo project one day so why don't we make guesses on what it could look like? I'll start.



Is it just me— I can't imagine Heeseung promoting on music shows? Hear me out.


His music taste is very RnB, Modern Pop, Romance, Ballad, and has some mature themes (which as an adult, I love). He always does it in a way that isn't cringe, you know? It suits him. Like Enhypen, his personal color seems to appeal to a more global audience than just Korea. His music is going to be *so good* but I can't imagine him putting out the type of music you peform at music bank. His genre style goes beyond Kpop imo.


And if he goes by Evan, I think he'll debut with a more unconventional promo. It reminds me of the way Agust D or RM doesn't go to music shows. Maybe he'll have a music video, appear in radio shows, live performances, and interviews instead.

excited is an understatement. i've said this a million times since coachella but this is my first comeback as an engene so the idea of me seeing them in concert and i just discovered them last december has me smiling uncontrollably. especially because the album comes out a month before so i have time to learn everything i need to and plan my outfit. i already preordered every version of the album there is and i'm thinking of getting a cute keychain for my photocards. might get some cute pins too.

Enhypenthoughts,1keem5u,2025-05-04 10:00:43,Who got into ENHYPEN during the Romance Untold era? What made you stan?,"The subreddit census is out and it looks like Enhypen gained a lot of new fans during Romance Untold. This is considering the Reddit census, Billboard, album sales, etc during this comeback. It all points to Romance Untold being one of their biggest comebacks.



I’m one of the people who only discovered Enhypen during this era. For me, it was the songs first. I never even knew their names, faces, or how many members. I just decided to randomly listen one day and the songs hooked me. It was that good. That’s what made me start looking them up. And once I did, I couldn’t stop.


The music was the gateway, but their personalities are what really locked me in as an Engene. I went in completely blind and I’m so glad I did.


So what about you? What made you become an Engene during this era? What did you love about the album? What locked you in?

Enhypenthoughts,1kdgojs,2025-05-03 02:51:50,What I love about Heeseung’s Voice,"What do you love about his voice or how would you describe it? I feel like Heeseung is so underrated in the conversation of Kpop vocalists and I don’t know why? His voice stands out so much to me, mostly because he does something not a lot of Kpop idols do, he actually puts emotion and effort into his singing. A lot of newer groups and idols focus more on dance and fan service (which is fine because kpop is never just about vocals anyway), but you can really tell that Heeseung cares about how he sounds on each song, and always seems to add life to everything he sings. He also has a very good natural tone and vibrato which makes his voice pleasant to listen to in general. 

Some of my favorite covers of his are:
• Sofa https://youtu.be/KZKtKXWXBnU?si=6A3ypCORyn_fvpGH
• Love Wins All https://youtu.be/vrBC0Pd-Zz4?si=xNiyCHuTQj3FHHqa

• Love https://youtu.be/DGdsbUOA8zQ?si=QmUBJHZchwicBzmi
(I’m not sure how to embed links on here, I don’t use reddit much, sorry if it’s messy) 
these performances show my favorite aspects of his vocals like the emotion he puts.

Enhypenthoughts,1kblwvn,2025-04-30 19:15:49,Could ENHYPEN Be Close to ILLIT?,"i've always been a huge enhypen stan and just recently got into illit, and I’ve been watching all the enhypen x illit interactions, but it mostly seems like tiktoks and behind-the-scenes clips so ’ve been wondering how close enhypen and illit really are. from what we’ve seen, they definitely have a solid sunbae-hoobae vibe, right? there’s mutual respect, they seem chill, but maybe a little shy around each other but I’m wondering, are they actually friends or is it more of a professional labelmate relationship? 

it also makes me wonder how much time enha and illit really get to spend together outside of work, especially since the enhypen members mostly stick to themselves. and jungwon seems like the only one who's really vocal about supporting illit. maybe i’m expecting too much, or do you think they could get closer over time?

on a different note, does anyone else feel the same way about tiktoks? I mean, I love them, but they’re usually part of their schedules that only happens every comeback/promotions, and there’s always like 20+ staff behind the scenes while filming it😭 kinda want those random tiktoks that jaemin, karina, giselle, and jeno did. those felt so much more real and fun....am I expecting too much, or do others feel the same way? 

and thinking back on past groups, it feels like labelmates used to have a more sibling-like energy, right? like with super junior & snsd, shinee & f(x), red velvet & exo, twice & got7, stray kids & itzy... they were always pulling pranks, teasing, suprising each other during birthdays, randomly talking about them and genuinely seemed like family. even with newer groups, like aespa and nct, you can see that same bond. i love how ningning and chenle had a banter around over pubg,  that’s the kind of vibe i’m talking about! not just about work or performances, but those behind-the-scenes moments that show they’re real friends. do you think that kind of closeness is possible with enha & illit?

Isn't that part of the allure of vampires? The charming ease? Like they don't have to try hard to lure you in.

The sexiness also looks more natural because of the subtlety of it. And in my opinion, men look sexier in good outfits and accessories than being half-naked (personal preference).",119,14

Yeah I know the girlies were eating it up but I still think someone of Ni-kis or Jungwons age shouldn’t be doing all that at that age??? Idk guess I’m just overly protective knowing how some people can get. What was the response during that time? I know it’s one of their most popular songs but I wasn’t really on the enhypen side of twitter or tik tok. ,35,12
Enhypenthoughts,1kag7st,2025-04-29 07:13:18,Who are your top 3 in enha in every category?,"Vocals (flavor and technique combined)
1. Heeseung- He's got a good vocal tone and best technique for me. It's not his tone that makes it special but something about the way he sings. Stable, flavorful, technical, good diction.
2. Jake- Personally, I like his tone the most, his accent just makes his singing and the overall vibe of the song better. Also stable and no matter the techniques are, his voice is consistently flavorful. Stable, consistently flavorful, the accent! 
3. Jay- Jay in english songs>>> His tone pops better in english than in korean, there's a rasp, power, and brightness in his voice. Stable, powerful, good diction.

Dance
1. Jungwon and Ni-ki- this one is a tie! Ni-ki's technique never fails to amaze me, Jungwon's body control is just immaculate and it got me captivated all the time. 
2. Jay- His dance is consistently clean and has great energy distribution overall, there seems nothing lacking in his dance, he can easily be a lead dancer in other groups.
3. Heeseung- though energy distribution wise is not that good but he is so captivating everytime he is on the center (no, actually he is captivating all the time) and I can't seem to take my eyes off of him. In technical analysis, his captivatingness makes up for his inconsistent energy.
(But to be honest, I think those are intentional: he knows when to be powerful and when he should tone it down)

Visuals (I divided it into 2 types, visuals that gets better the more you look at it and a visual that looks beautiful at first glance  and is consistent, I prefer the fine one)
1. Heeseung- This is quite an unexpected of me but Heeseung is the last one I appreciated visually. He may not be my type at first glance but the more and longer I look at him, he seems to become *more -and-more* handsome (?) I hope it makes sense. He is so fine, *Fine*! I think is the best word to describe his face. 
2. Sunoo- same as Heeseung, Sunoo just becomes more attractive, cute at first glance but gets *Handsome* the more I look at him. His face is just something I can never get tired of looking at. 
3. Jay- Jay's visual is a breath of fresh air to me, his facial features are so sharp but depending on the expression, his face can range from very fierce to very soft. His eyes are so sweet to look at and I will never get tired of looking at it whenever he smiles. 

Stage presence (they have contrasts that their performance feels like waves, it pulls you in at the same time pushes you out, it penetrates sometimes softens)
1. Jungwon and Sunoo-
It's so hard to choose between them, Jungwon has this rage in him that expands throughout the stage and audience that you couldn't help but feel it. Sunoo has this grace and quiet confidence that radiates whenever it's his part or him in the center, he stands out to me because he is a contrast that helps balance out the group. (He also looks angelic up close)
2. Heeseung and Jay-
Both are so consistent, One lures, another scares (Hope it makes sense)
Heeseung pulls you in, Jay's rage sometimes can scare you but in a magnetic way. Seriously, Everytime Heeseung shows up in screen and makes eye contact with the camera, it feels like He and I are the only ones that exists in the world. Jay is so consistent energetically and performance-wise, his vocals always gave me goosebumps. 
3. Ni-ki- Very consistent, dancing is immaculate, captivating, powerful, vocals are deep, ashy, and beautiful. 
One thing ni-ki failed me to do is to stop me from screaming my lungs out for him, seriously...

How about you guys, who are your top 3?",50,27
Enhypenthoughts,1kae2xb,2025-04-29 05:06:51,"Not your bias, but you find them breathtakingly attractive.","I just saw a post in a kpop subreddit and saw Jay mentioned and I wanted to comment all of Enhypen but that seems excessive lol

They are all very attractive individuals but their faces are not bland to look at. Idk if you get what I mean. Their faces are interesting. They're not just conventionally attractive.

I find Jungwon really pretty because of his eyes. His eyes are really the main point, esp when they used to use eyeliner on his lower lashline. And also, the small curve on his jawline. It's just different from the usual straight and sharp jawline.

But aside from Jungwon, I find Jay's face really attractive. Esp when his face is slightly tilted to the side, he's smiling with his teeth, and his hair falls over his face, slightly covering his eyes. The hair and smile softens his sharp features, making it look balanced. 

I think I find his face interesting because while his features are so sharp and defined, sometimes Jay can look soft and gentle and cute with his facial expressions and his smile.

We've been fortunate enough the past year to be largely unaffected by the drop that most other groups have experienced, but with the combination of Cbars boycotting (they contributed to roughly 1/3 of R:U's 3 million), financial instability in the US, Japan, and China, and the overall decrease in interest in Kpop worldwide, I fear that this will finally be when the hammer drops.

I know in the grand scheme of things it's not that big of a deal, because despite the drop in physical sales, their seniors are still successful and loved.

that said, as someone on stantwt i came across a post that pointed out the antler-chandelier kinda thing in the promo calendar was one from the bthb mv and that piqued my curiosity, hence me writing this post.

i've seen oomfs put forth their own theories ranging on a spectrum from enha being lab subjects and trying to escape to find chloe and d:u being set even before border: carnival, before they escaped the lab and became preys being hunted to my personal contribution, though little, that from the cb calendar it seems as if chloe's the one searching for them, hence the shaky camera and unsteady hands, as well as the close inspection of every object.

Enhypenthoughts,1k87a2d,2025-04-26 09:21:33,engenes overanalyze too much,"thats the main problem why this fandom has gone shit and well, it honestly has been shit from the start.

everything starts from overanalyzing and assuming. everybody in the fandom seem to overanalyze every single action the boys do which is insane btw because not everything has meaning into it. sunghoon could be staring into blank space and somehow engenes would make it into something that he must be sad and gloomy when thats just a normal occurence from him.

interactions between the boys are most of all overanalyzed. i haven't watched the enoclock everyone seems to be making a fuss about but imo, everyone just seems to see and treat sunoo as a fragile person. hell, with all this people always saying hes outcasted, it feels like people just want him to be bullied when he, is in fact NOT. and its just sunoo getting it for some reason. i feel like when other people (haters, akgaes) see a member interact with sunoo, the first thing they try to find is ""is this member being AT THE MINIMAL bad to him?"" which is then followed by some sheep engenes agreeing and the overanalysing start and it becomes an issue again.

literally, jay gets the most lashings from enha but nobody sees that as bullying bc we know damn well theyre joking. thats their dynamics. its so odd to me that people like singling out sunoo. its like they want it to be a reality.

and its not just overanalyzing the bad things its overanalyzing the positive things too. personally, i see enhypen the same as other people so i dont have high expectations for them but engenes put them on a pedestal so when they do a little mistake, engenes tend to over react too.

in conclusion, if engenes stop overanalysing we would be in a much better place. yall need to stop putting meaning into everything. engenes are just so dramatic

Did any of you lucky bastards score VIP 1? If so I bow in awe and respect of your tremendous luck and skill. 

I had high hopes of scoring Paris tickets and that was an absolute myth! I can’t believe how quickly they sold out. I know En- are huge in France but I didn’t realise just how big they were until I saw 30K people in front of me on a queue I was waiting to join an hour before it opened.

heeseung-vanilla cake itself, because his voice is pretty much the pillar of all the songs. wouldn't truly be one without him especially. not a cake without cake. and one thing about vanilla is that it compliments pretty much any flavor, which mirrors the versatility of heeseungs voice. bro fits literally any song 

jay would be the dark chocolate ganache layer, because his voice is recognizable & powerful.

sunoo would be the white chocolate ganache layer because his tone is always very sweet and he adds the hint of sugar enhypen songs always have. 

sunghoon would fr be the cream cheese frosting  ontop and on the sides of the cake with intricate patterns. his voice is very rich and delicate. 

jake would be the fresh assorted fruit toppings covering the circumfrence of the cake. he always adds that freshness to their songs, and you feel refreshed listening to his song cover too.

jungwon would definitely be the coconut shavings on the cake and the sides. he wraps everything together and coconut offers a new complex flavor. 

ni-ki would be a coffee sauce drizzle. earthy, dark but a hint of sweetness. if you think hard enough, that sweetness was there all along.

Enhypenthoughts,1k6pvfr,2025-04-24 13:30:05,Dear Enhypen…(yes I know they don’t read here 😂),"It wasn’t supposed to be like this. You were my daughter’s first KPop concert almost a year ago. I was just along for the ride. My girls are 17 and 20 and at that age where mom isn’t needed as much anymore, and I felt like I was losing the closeness we once had.

Enter Enhypen. At first, I was just their concert chauffeur, as I wasn’t comfortable letting them drive the 2.5 hours to Chicago alone. I made it through about half the concert (I only knew like 2 songs at the time!) then I went and sat in a lounge for the second half because I was completely overstimulated.

All I knew was one of them had been a figure skater, which I loved because all my daughters skate, and I’ve skated/coached for many years.

But over the past year, not sure if this was their plan, or if it just kind of happened. It started with them just wanting me to learn all their names and faces. Which took me FOREVER. But once that was accomplished, somehow they had me hooked. Suddenly I’m the one coming to them to watch new content. Throwing a themed Enchella viewing party. And scheming strategies to get send-off (big fail yesterday though)…

I know it sounds super corny, but this group has mended my relationship with my girls, and brought our bond back. This was what we needed. And I am so grateful. 

Anyway. Just wanted to share and this seemed like the place for it! Now…fingers crossed and vibes sent into the universe that we have better luck for the United Center public sale on Friday. My 17-year-olds dream is for Sunghoon to sign her skates at send-off 😂 ",190,33

I hope Engenes want to go see Enhypen bc they actually want to see them perform in concert and not just for interactions.

Enhypenthoughts,1k6uzt9,2025-04-24 17:25:20,are en-o'clock breaks really that bad?,"Please tell me if I used the wrong flair. Also, I feel like my view is very biased because I don’t keep up that often with the episodes and just Enha’s variety shows in general.

They recently announced that EN-O'CLOCK is going to take a break, and that means we’re really in the comeback season now. If I’m not mistaken, before this season of EN-O'CLOCK, it has been gone for like half a year or so?

Other than Engenes being excited that the comeback details would really be approaching soon, the others are sad that we won’t be getting any episodes in a while and some are even scared that the previous long break might happen again. 

My question is, don’t Engenes want ENHYPEN to rest? Because, I don’t know, if you’re able to choose whether the boys do their variety just for fans or actually take the break they deserve after all the promotions and stuff, which one are you going to choose? Not to mention that they’re having another tour.

In that live last year on Christmas, I think the members mentioned something like resting somewhere in the second half of the year. Correct me if I am wrong. And if it is true, we just don’t know how long exactly they’re going to rest until the company pushes them into a pile of schedules again. 

TL;DR : I don’t understand Engenes who say that they want the boys to rest but also keep on pushing/insisting for them to appear in more stuff as much as possible—inadvertently, more schedules.",45,16

Enhypenthoughts,1k6d7po,2025-04-24 01:07:03,Investigating the sudden surge of d- threats under every kpop tiktok account,"I’ve noticed a lot of fandoms bring up the really disturbing comments that they’ve found on tiktok so I just wanted to share so we can work together to get rid of these accounts.

The comments are usually under enhypen pfps, or the occasional njz or carmen from h2h pfp, and are constantly commenting disturbing things referencing moonbin or sulli. I’ve seen them comment on lsf’s account, stray kids’, nct’s , exo’s, treasure etc. 

[similar comments spammed everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/2szcwuz81owe1.jpg?width=383&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ede7ffc671944c41af5855c56b5ba56bb77a24e)

Joy from Russia also had a link in her bio to a WhatsApp channel with over 10,000 people. It was removed after a few hours but we think this is where the commenters are organising. The admin is called jjyyke [who’s posted dts towards sunoo](https://x.com/ftalsunoo/status/1907436671789862980), has apparently [leaked the members phone numbers](https://x.com/imnotabellz/status/1883392789968486532) (though people call them a scammer). 

[tiktok bios with the same whatsapp channel link](https://preview.redd.it/b3v7ni3a1owe1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2e9d7fa644d7266e09f559bee0ab29b0285997b)

We’ve found out that these accounts are all from the same country, and that they rebrand during each kpop drama. Many of them rebranded to enhypen stan accounts a bit before coachella to comment disturbing things and to set enhypen and engenes up (which has worked very well for them so they haven’t gotten bored yet). They all seem to comment very similar things which shows there seems to be a certain amount of planning involved. The same accounts are also the ones behind the ILLIT comments on their tiktoks & the ones who spread lies about NewJeans. They did the same to RIIZE & Seunghan. I think more people are noticing these accounts because they want to hate on enhypen / engenes but this issue has been going on for months and they been targeting many kpop groups. 

[accounts rebranding a bit before coachella to set up enhypen](https://preview.redd.it/wwhb3kxc1owe1.jpg?width=360&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26aa9c8e60e741631cdf36db92a148e5e2b93ff8)

The thing is, it’s really easy to create burner accounts on tiktok so I’m not sure what the best solution is, but we can’t keep giving trolls the attention they want 😭 I think before that some of them were pretending to be tokkis during the MHJ hybe drama, now they’re pretending to be engenes for obvious reasons. 

I just want to clarify that these accounts aren’t actually engenes, tokkis or carmen stans. I thought most people would be able to tell these comments are rage bait, but evidently I think the situation needs clarification and the fact that this is organised needs to be highlighted. It’s definitely more wide spread than we think it and it’s not just enhypen they’re targeting, but the enhypen set up accs seem to be getting the most attention. Please comment down below if you have any more info! 

The channel has reportedly been deleted, but the bios of two of the set up accounts have updated to say “From today to june … 😊👍” and again, matching bios shows organisation and also enhypen have their cb in June 💀 also, earlier this year the WhatsApp channel had 42k followers and now they have 10k so I’m guessing they restart every now and again? [I know moas were trying to get their channel suspended earlier this year.](https://x.com/TXT_DailyNews/status/1883745592758972866)

the ticket is now under her name on ticketmaster but when scanning the ticket at day of, will we get into any trouble?? since it was a presale ticket?? i’ve never been to a concert before so i don’t know all the check in, id check nuances and i know i should’ve thought about it before transferring the ticket to her but we were so excited and didn’t think😞😞

Enhypenthoughts,1k4dlt3,2025-04-21 15:31:49,Countries that I think that would never be excluded from enhypen's world tours,"Now that Enhypen is finally including Europe in their tour (and hopefully Latin America soon!!!), let’s talk about the countries that seem like they’ll always be part of their tour map. No matter how many stops are being added or removed, there are certain countries that always seem to be present. Whether it’s due to the size of the fanbase, the energy of the crowd, or the strong connection with the group, these places are key stops for Enhypen.

Korea – This one’s a given. It’s their home base, so of course, it’s always on the list.

Japan – Japan is almost always included on every kpop group’s tour map, and enhypen is no exception. With ni-ki being japanese, the group has naturally cultivated a deep connection with japanese engenes. The fanbase there is incredibly loyal and passionate, consistently showing up with massive support for every comeback, concert, and project. Japan is also one of enhypen's biggest markets in terms of album sales. Japanese engenes have played a key role in shaping the group’s international reputation and success, making them one of the strongest pillars of the fandom.

USA – The U.S. is a key market for any global artist, and enhypen has a solid fanbase there. The energy at their U.S. shows is always high, making it a staple stop on their tour. The demand for enhypen is strong in major cities, and it’s clear that their presence in the U.S. continues to grow.

Philippines – I don’t think the Philippines has ever been skipped since enhypen's first world tour and rightfully so! Filipino engenes are behind some of the biggest fanbases and projects we have, and they’re incredibly consistent with their support and streaming. They’re definitely one of the backbones of the fandom. I can always count on them to make sure enhypen feels loved, and it’s nice to see their love is being reciprocated by the members. It’s clear that enhypen has a strong bond with their filipino fans, and the energy at their concerts there is unmatched. It’s definitely a country that always seems to have a spot on the tour list. 

Thailand – Thailand is another country that’s become a consistent stop for enhypen, especially after they sold out Rajamangala Stadium. The strong fan support in Thailand has made it a must-visit for enhypen, and the energy from the crowd is incredible. It’s safe to say Thailand is firmly on the map for future tours. They're also consistent with their support and streaming!

These are the countries I believe will likely remain on enhypen's tour list. However, it’s exciting to think about how the group will continue to expand to new places in the future as their global fanbase grows! What are your thoughts?",34,18

Enhypenthoughts,1k45e7c,2025-04-21 06:48:20,my enchella experience <3,"literally a fever dream. i kept saying i was going to go but i didn’t buy my ticket until 1:30am day of. i had nothing actually planned😭😭😭

i got there two sets before enhypen and made my way through to the right side of the stage since it was pretty empty over there. after shoreline mafia i followed everyone out to get closer to the center and i was happy with my spot! idk what happened though, once enha came out i ended up super to the side and could hardly see them most of the time, even though i was like 4 people back from the barricade. 

most of my videos came out horrible and i’m so sad because for some reason i hardly remember any of it. like i saw clips of things they said or did and i literally didn’t hear them say that? i don’t know what happened😭so i only have a few good clips from when they came to the side to remember it by. and usually after a show the concert versions of the songs & live adlibs are the only thing i hear when i listen to the original, but now i literallt just don’t know how i went cus i wasnt processing it in the moment. i’m sad that i don’t remember it and i don’t have good videos to look back on, especially since they don’t perform these versions of the songs or some of the songs on tour at all (moonstruck band version, daydream, blockbuster, the different instrumentals for xo & no doubt) so this was my one chance to experience them. 

that being said. i can’t believe i actually saw them. it was my first time seeing enhypen AND my first coachella and i had a great time. i was so happy to be there when they announced desire:unleash. they looked so good, sounded even better, stage presence was everything. i’m so grateful to have been there, even if things could have went better this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and i’m so thankful for it.

however i do love that army and everyone else on twitter is loving enhypen. this is how it should be. fandoms coming together and supporting our favs and helping new fans learn about them as a group and individually

Back then we were called eggies. I just want to say, they have come so far as artists and I'm proud that they did. They have gotten so much flak during their debut to their rookie years for their vocals. The members promised that they will improve. And they definitely did. Their vocals on coachella is so good. The lack of backing track in some of the songs in their sets while dancing those steps is insane. Sometimes, when one is already popular they will get comfortable and just stay like how they are but enha always pushes for more and to be more. They only did not improve on their vocals/stamina, they also improved on their facial expressions, dance, crowdwork. Their confidence is also so palpable. I'm just an impressed eggie so I need to get these out 🥹",143,5

They completely blew us away. 

Their live vocals for the entire set were incredibly impressive. Seriously extremely well done. Week 1 was great and week 2 was somehow even better and they finished their set with such amazing energy. For context, my family and I have been k pop fans for years and are casual listeners of many different kpop/kpop adjacent artists. We knew a bit about enhypen beforehand and were interested to see how their Coachella performance would be. We are avid music fans in this house so we have been streaming Coachella both weekends every day and watching most of the major and many of the smaller acts as well. Enhypens set is now one of our favorites (easily top 10 of the weekend). They absolutely crushed it. Seriously… they should be extremely proud of themselves!!!! 

Family and I now currently planning to attend their tour!!!

I think I was calmer this time around. I was still excited but not as much as the first week since I already knew what to expect. Having said that, I was also not anxious anymore because I knew they would do well. 

Did anyone notice how much more confident and relaxed they were this week compared to last week?

Last week, they were nervous and excited but they have prepared so much so they still did well. But this time, they already knew how the crowd reacted to the performances so they have allowed themselves to be more ""loose"" on stage.

Heeseung changed some notes in some songs. He was even flirtier this time and worked the crowd harder! 

Jay has gained 1000x aura this week. Maybe it's his birthday so he's also more relaxed and just happy to perform.

Jungwon changed up some parts where he didn't sing (I think it was in the Bite Me chorus, at the top of my head). He was also smiley and bouncy on stage 🥹

Jake said some curse words hahahaha. I saw a tweet that said ""last week I learned he was talented. This week I realized he was hot"". And that pretty much summed up his performance.

Sunoo was also visibly more confident this time! And his hair styled up ughh perfection!

Sunghoon finally removed his jacket hahahaha. He still has that quiet confidence but he was somehow more captivating this time.

Ni-ki was a hot topic! He was feeling this performance. And his live voice was also noticeable especially in low notes which sounded lower than last week.

LOVE THE STYLING AND THE OUTFITS!!! God I was so happy they changed their outfits.

I loved Sunoo and Ni-ki's outfits the most 🥹

I was watching the live with my sister and every time the camera would focus on a member, she would say ""handsome"" like it's some catchphrase that only Enhypen could elicit from her mouth lol. She even said that everyone is good-looking and ""thank you Korea for giving us these handsome men"" 🤣

Are you guys excited for the comeback? It's still pretty chill on Twitter so I'm enjoying this happy moment before all hell breaks loose because... you know... people throw rocks on things that shine and Engypen is pretty blinding.

Enhypenthoughts,1k309h0,2025-04-19 18:31:13,"ENCHELLA W1 FITS, CONCEPT AND SET","m so excited for enha to be wearing diff fits for w2 lets talk abt what went wrong with w1

first off enchella was a HUGE hit on behalf of the boys they slayed the vocals, dance, stage presence and even managed to salvage the outfits with their amazing face cards.. i just wish prada and enha's technical&creative team would have given justice to the boy's hard work cuz those sets and fits were not it!!

OUTFITS: public backlash for the outfits was really not a surprise, i mean they werent bad but they deff were not giving ""we r performing at one of THE biggest music festivals in the whole world""...honestly even the iconic ""tampon/pads"" fit that enha wore for MAMA2023 were more flashy than these..the concept was denim and it was fine cuz denim is just a fabric and there r so many ways to style it but they just threw on jackets and called it a day.. hell.what were hoon and jake's outfits?? they looked like they were going downtown to grab food rather than performing at coachella.. and these two have such good style that they prolly wear better clothes than this even while walking their dogs.. prada usually slays so what happened here?? like be fr what is the difference between a prada stylist/designer and an H&M salesperson selling the same damn jacket and jeans in literally every mall to ever exist?? i really hope enha's stylists take over for w2 cuz they NEVER dissapoint!! \[they already saved w1 by restyling the scarves on the members..thanku so much for that!!\]

CONCEPT&SETS : the concept was ""enhypen at coachella, going to the dessert denim style"" cuz enha's creative team really thought ""ohh..coachella=desert=cowboys=conclusion : denim"".. its fine really, there is really nothing wrong with it, but personally i guess engenes can agree with me when i say i would have wanted ""enhypen arriving at coachella, the vampires visiting the desert to paint it bloddy red"" cuz now comeon- we engenes love enha's vampire lore.. it is undoubtedly one of the best branding and concept in all of kpop.. enha experiments with their music, sound, aesthetics and visuals but it is the vampire concept that integrates everything and makes each comeback special and relevant to the changing trends... it was truly such a shame to see no vampire representation at coachella i think it would have captivated many locals and brought more curiosity to the grp...and the sets?? like r u fr belift?? enha pulled 63M US$ for u last year and THESE r the sets?? where was the budget?? did lisa and enha really perform on the same stage?? oh yeah!! they did...i couldnt notice it over lisa's glowing corsets- BELIFT!! U CAN DO BETTER!!...the only noticable thing abt the w1 set was the pink moon during moonstruck...the ONLY reference to the lore ...i dont think they will make any changes in the sets for w2 but hey a girl can have hope...

overall the whole performance was really good...i was not taken aback by their perfect vocals cuz its ENHYPEN duh...they always slay even without trying...but i was suprised that we focused more on the vocals than dancing cuz enha is known for having overthetop amazing insync choreos..but they prolly focused more on vocals due to the limited time and 45 min nonstop performance which drains a lot of energy...but i want more locals to notice their knife sharp dancing skills cuz they r toooo good....i also wish there were more crowd interactions but again....they had limited time..they didnt even get to say gbye properly!!...but they slayed too hard with the amt of time they were given!!...sooo yayyy!! also i dont understand how nonengenes are so shocked by their performance like yes they served but the thing is they ALWAYS serve.... i wonder how amazed they'd be after watching enha's mama or goldendisk performances...anyways how was yall's experience with enchella??

Still, haters still found a way to attack them so let's lock in for Weekend 2. Maybe we can share tips on locking in for Weekend 2? 


Here are a few:


1. **Report and block** any obvious setup or rage bait accounts.  

  
2. **Don't engage in unnecessary fanwars.** It’s okay to correct misinformation, but if the convo is clearly going nowhere or meant to provoke, just report and move on.  

  
3. **Use the official hashtags on X!**  


  
4. **Avoid spamming the Coachella YouTube chat when it's not ENHYPEN's turn.** Some Coachella goers were annoyed that their fave artists were being drowned out by Kpop chat spams. Let’s be respectful.  

  
5. **Be vigilant on Reddit** where discourse can get ugly fast. Report anything in bad faith.  

  
6. Watch the performance on the **official Coachella channels!**  
7. **Hype them up!** Talk about the good stuff, share and like positive videos. Welcome the new fans!

Enhypenthoughts,1k0s8bu,2025-04-16 20:51:39,Has anyone else noticed Jake has lowkey vice-leader energy?,"Jake looks like a playful puppy type but has anyone noticed he also seems to be a lowkey leader-type? He's the one who keeps the members in line often, like when they're being too chaotic or loud, Jake's the one who calms them down.

He also has a really authoritative (and hot) voice like when he told Ni-Ki and Sunoo to sit down so they can film the closing for En o Clock. There's also that time when Sunoo and Jay were playing with balloons on Weverse and Jake took away their balloons to not block the camera angle. Behind the scenes, he's often talks to staff about stage directions and gives a lot of input (not just because he speaks English). He looks really leader-like when he's in work mode.

He just seems really responsible. He's the one who often reminds the members where to stand on set, to be mindful of the camera, and to not block each other's views. He gently pulls them or shows them where to stand to help the staff filming.

He also makes sure the members don't step too close to the edge of the stage and secures their safety in the concerts. There's compilations of Jake being hyper-aware of the members' on stage for their safety. It's like he in tune with the 6 members, at all times because he always observes everyone's surroundings. It's like he has eyes at the back of his head.


I get why Jungwon would call Jake first in an emergency. If Jungwon had a vice-leader, I think it'd be Jake because of how responsible he is. Heeseung is amazing too but Heeseung is more of a reliable-older brother type while Jake seems more like the disciplining-type lol.


Does anyone get that vibe from Jake that he's one of the lowkey leaders of Enhypen? Aside from Jungwon, I think both Jake and Heeseung help keep the team in line behind the scenes.

This went on longer than I thought but I found this interview of Jake and it shows how sensitive he his to all the members.


>**JAKE:** SUNOO likes talking, for example, so I try my best to listen to him, and then NI-KI is more active, but surprisingly sensitive—the kind of person who needs to be treated with care. SUNGHOON can be spoken to directly—maybe because he played sports—and JAY’s similar but surprisingly mature and so he likes to talk about his feelings and emotions and I’m all ears when he talks to me about them. JUNGWON doesn’t like to approach his concerns like they’re concerns, so he just calls me over and talks about them indirectly. He’s so cute. And HEESEUNG is a fun guy but has a lot on his plate so I try and listen to him as much as possible.

My only gripe is that ENHYPEN IS OVERWORKED. They’ve been non stop touring/ comebacks/ events/releasing content for almost a year straight now (if not more). And they’re doing this for Engenes too. 

I thought we (engenes) didn’t want this tour to begin with BECAUSE Enhypen is so overworked. It’s a little jarring to see Engenes switch up and now demand that Enhypen work EVEN MORE for them via more tour dates etc.

Jungwon - Okay I can totally see him being another Taemin or Kai and think hell suit either of the kind of music both of them make

Hopefull someone can clarify, because I can only spare the day of the concert and perhaps a few hours to travel ..  if it's more than a couple of days than I don't think I can be buying a ticket ...

I understand that Hybe groups mostly don't tour AUS/NZ much compared to their non-Hybe contemporaries, but man this argument is tiring as hell. 

One, many of the non-Hybe groups have toured Australia, with some extending to New Zealand, one group had a stadium concert here in two cities. 

Another one, for other Hybe groups it makes sense not touring Australia because, they have no native members, but JAKE??? he is from Brisbane and yet BELIFT haven't considered Australia for once?? If not Brisbane, at least Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra. And this is the third tour, if not including Fate+ tour where this is happening, JUST WHY??

It's still heartbreaking not because of travelling overseas for concerts to meet by bias, the fact is my bias and I share the same place of native, yet the company never gave a chance to tour in this country whereas other groups are touring here. 

This might be repetitive, for people who know me here always asking and ranting about Enhypen coming to Australia, but stll I'm not happy. I will try when the tickets come on sale, and getting or not is at God's hands.

Enhypenthoughts,1jzmve1,2025-04-15 10:37:01,Possibly the reason I love Enhypen songs,"This is just a personal preference (can't stress this enough), but I think I might like Enhypen's discography because there's little to no rap and they stick to the formula.

Even songs like Pass the Mic that have some flow, don't have any rap parts/verses outside the main song structure. I'm not a huge fan of kpop-style rap because it can feel out of place or jarring sometimes in really melodic songs that aren't otherwise bar-heavy. This might be strategic, to lower the barrier to entry for non-kpop listeners.

Anyway, I feel like other listeners might share this POV.
N.B.: I do like some of BP's songs with the really fire rap parts.

Enhypen absolutely crushed their Coachella debut. The energy, the stage presence, the vocals, everything was just perfect.
I loved the setlist, truly. But there were a few songs I really wish they had included.

Teeth (OT7 version)
This one has that dark, grungy phonk club vibe that would’ve hit so hard live. An OT7 version? ?? I would have gone feral.

Fever
Yes it’s slower, yes it’s more sensual, but imagine the red lights, just their silhouettes, that slow build. It’s one of their most iconic songs and it would’ve added a really cool moment to the set.

Attention, Please!
This song has opener energy written all over it. It’s loud, chaotic in the best way, and would’ve instantly hyped the crowd. I could honestly see it replacing Blockbuster as the intro👀👀.

Bills
This should’ve been the closer. It has that perfect mix of emotion and energy, something to leave the audience buzzing. Such a missed opportunity.

3) Can I buy presale tickets to two venues? Just theoretically. Eg buying one ticket in LA, buying one ticket in NY. I’m just thinking about it bc I’m not sure which venue would work better for me in August. And as I understand, it would be possible to resell one of the tickets, right?

ENHYPEN the group derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-), representing ""**Connection, Discovery, & Growth**"". Similar to how a hyphen connects different words to create new meanings, Enhypen aims ""to come together to connect, discover and grow together to form a new act"".  \[i got this part from google but the rest i carefully typed out haaa hardwork something i dont do often but i will for u cuz i dont even kno u but u r now an engene so i like u\]

they r a really unique grp...formed by a reality survival show called I-LAND..then the 7 chosen members became ""ENHYPEN""...they debuted 30 NOV 2020 with the song given-taken(a fucking bop)

they used to be known as monster rookies and the legendary debut...they still r the fastest grp to have win rookie of the year award in just 12days after their debut...

1. YANG JUNGWON (blonde sleveless guy) :  born 9 February 2004(21)..hes the leader and is known for his unique voice and powerfull dance (hes one of my biases lol i am so happy u noticed him) also former taekwondo player

2. LEE HEESEUNG (redhaired guy) : 15 October 2001(23)..the oldest member, also called the ace..he is known for being good in everything..literally everything.. he is the unofficial centre and main vocalist..he also raps even tho their songs dont contain much raps..also a strong dancer and he has perfect pitch..

JAY (*Park Jong-seong) (blue tucked jewelled shirt): A*pril 20, 2002*(22).. he is the rockstar, he loves his guitar..hes vocally soo talented and an underrated dancer hes also the member known for hiphop dance style and fashion..effortlessly cool and super hot..his jawline is so sharp we sometimes call it jayline lol..hes korean american born in seattle, washington.*

*4. JAKE (sim jaeyun) (jean jacket with brown collar):* 15 Nov 2002 (22) hes korean-australian..he used to play violin and bass in school..hes known for his smooth sexy voice and clean dance moves even tho he trained the least among the members..he beat 500 members in Belift global auditions to get into ILAND...also the main rizzler of enhypen lol

5. PARK SUNGHOON (plain jean jacket on jeans) : 8 Dec 2002 (22) former figure skater..he is known as the ice prince for his breathetaking visuals (tbh all of enhypen are so visually attractive) he has a unique voice and in strong in dancing like all the others..also his eyebrows are super thick idk why im mentioning this but yeah...

6. KIM SUNOO (green shirt shortblack hair) : 24 June 2003 (21) i would say he has the most stable vocals alongside heeseung..easily one of the best singers of the grp..even tho he doesnt praise his dancing too much hes just as good as all the other members..he is known as a cutie pie but his duality is insane he can be sooo cute and instantly become so hottt..

7. NI-KI (Nishimura Riki) (silver hair with shiny tucked jeanjacket) : 9 Dec 2005 (19) he is japanese, his role model is Michael Jackson, he is known for his amazing dancing easily one of the best dancers of entire kpop..not even joking cuz he was personally trained by kento mori who is a legend in the dance world recognised by THE Michael Jackson himself..he has a deep voice and gets a lot of raps in their songs...

\* SONGS : they are known all over for having a NOSKIP discography..literally every song that they put out r fucking bops..they slay sooo hard..a few amazing songs to check out r fever, drunk dazed, bite me, shout out, polaroid love, daydream, criminal love and sooo much more there discography is my paradise..

\* DANCE : they are in no doubt the strongest dance lines in all of kpop, their choreos are particularily challenging and demand a lot of energy but yet they slay with perfect stable vocals..check out ""drunk dazed"" choreo they literally jump so high in the air and still serve vocals there is also a part near the end where they get on the damn floor im not gonna spoil it check it out for urself and, ""pass the mic"" 's choreo is regarded as one of the most difficult songs to dance to in all of kpop..and the energy it requires has made ppl cry before no joke..

\* VOCAL KINGS : even tho heeseung and sunoo r the most stable and talented in singing all the other members take up equally challenging roles like jake, jay and jungwon get a lot of leading chorus lines and jay slays high notes, niki's deep vocals and sunghoon unique voice are underappreciated..

\* RAP : they r prolly one of the only boy grps out there with no proper rap lines in their songs..they dont take rapping as a neccesity but when it is required they slay!! all of them except sunoo have showed their rapping abilities before, niki and heeseung are mostly praised for raps but jay and jake's raps never dissappoint

\* FANDOM : we r called ENGENES cuz we r the engines that drive enhypen to success and we share their ""gene"".. engenes are known for being super pretty for some reason every engene that ppl have met r damned gorgeous!!

\* LORE : they r vampires...all of their songs are basically them being immortal vampires thru time..all of their mv's tell different stories abt their life and adventures..they have a webtoon ""DARK MOON"" which is a proper depiction of most of their lore..they also share the same universe with another hybe labels(japanese) boy grp &team(they r wearwolves)..its a cool lore to check when ur bored..most engenes theorise abt the lore like who gets the girl sooha(female lead of darkmoon representing engenes), who is being manipulated by the villan dardan(some rando villan in the webtoon) etc... its really cool to figure out clues and stuff..

Enhypenthoughts,1jyxakj,2025-04-14 14:10:49,STOP FANWARS...they r pathetic and make the whole fandom look like fools,"to all kpopstans in general and specially my fellow engenes lets just chill ok??...  
ppl who drag enhypen or anyother grp r not getting anywhere in life they r just seeking for drama and attention so dont pay any mind to them or try to ""defend"" anyone cuz enha and the bp girls already slayed coachella..and engenes, if u see any toxic fakeengenes hating on other grps call them out..  
lets make kpop a world standard cuz rn only the toxic fandoms are dragging down kpop's global status..all these fan wars just make nonkpopstans think kpop is monkeybizz..so lets just sit the fuck down relax and stan our idols instead of involving in shitshows..

 what are engenes known for?? for being gorgeous, calm, collected and fucking cool..so why r yall fighting with other fangrps online?? we all know that our idols r the best to us so why do we have to illogically defend them..when fans get too defensive it kind of seems as tho the idols are actually not talented and NEED defence but thats not true they r fucking awesome..so lets just leave the enha's talent to talk for itself cuz starting fanwars just undermines their hardwork...

literally when i think of engenes my mind brainstorms thru pictures of cool,stylish guys and pinterest coded hot girlies with each one having different asthetics but all of them being fucking gorgeous its like u get a glowup as soon as u join the fandom..all engenes have this air around them that just screams ""im expensive shit AND im the nicest person youll ever meet"" lowkey badass energy...engenes have this queen and king aura..so lets not ruin our image by acting like rabid dogs (saying that is an insult to even rabid dogs lol)...

there r so many grps suffering with toxic fandoms eg : toxicblinks, toxicarmys, ohh my god the cult like bunnyfandom, and more recently toxic stays r increasing in numbers..some of the toxic sides of these fandoms are sooo scary to be honest

hence conclusion lets QUALITY CONTROL!!, fandom clean and stay out of drama!!

DONT INTERACT WITH ANY HATE COMMENTS OR FANWARS 

IF ANY OTHER FANGRP WANTS TO DRAG ENHA LET THEM- BABE LET THEM RUN THEIR MOUTH...ITS NOT LIKE WE R LOOSING AURA JUST CUZ THEY R ACTING LIKE BITCHES ALRIGHT? GIVE THEM THE SILENT TREATMENT...

CAN WE ALSO CANCEL FAKE ENGENES AND SOLO STANS..THEY DONT EXIST TO US ANYMORE...UR EITHER AN ENGENE(having a bias is fine) OR A FAKE ONE PERIODT!!!

Enhypenthoughts,1jz2rr9,2025-04-14 18:12:54,"Too early to call upon, but I am lowkey worried about the BMO stadium concert, not kidding","One of my cousins trying to book tickets for the upcoming Ateez concert was shocked by the outrageous prices! They were double what was charged for last year's concert. It's worth noting that they announced the concert just 8 days after the previous one wrapped up! Seriously, it was unreasonably priced, even by K-pop standards. Many people have already voiced their concerns about this. I’m not exaggerating. With that kind of money, you could explore all of Seoul and catch a concert there.

I’m curious about the ticket situation for the WTL US leg, whether they’ve shared dates for other locations or just the one at BMO. If I need to book a ticket for the USA/Canada, it will be quite challenging for me. It would be even more frustrating if they haven’t revealed other locations like LATAM or Europe, resulting in limited options and being stuck with just the US stops.

I've saved up for the tour, but considering the current circumstances, I'm uncertain about my next steps. If anyone in the USA or traveling from abroad to see the concerts has any thoughts or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it! I'm really in need of some advice.

Edit: Yup, the dates for US and Europe are finally released. Trying for both. AEG is arranging the tour, who did the same for TXT and Ateez, not surprised. 

Those who got the tickets, congratulations in advance. ",13,9

He was the silent MVP in my opinion. Never missed a beat, flawless vocals, and always so chill. And the crowd interactions.

i know the setlist was super good and showcases enhypen well but somehow i want them to include go big or go home bc i swear its their best song to hear live,, the energy is festival too so i was looking forward to it

bc their time was tight they didnt even get to introduce themselves individually and i feel like they need more time so they can showcase their entire personality

i hope theres some changes next week even if its minor",43,23
Enhypenthoughts,1jynd50,2025-04-14 03:30:45,Enhypen in the eyes of their fans,"Just to distract us from the negativity on other platforms, I want to know how Enhypen are in the eyes of their fans. Put the months or years you have been an engene and share your thoughts on their growth from the minute you decided to stan them up to now.

*What made you like the group?*

*What are the highlights of being their fan?*

*How different are they from then?*

*Did you like their music's evolution? Why or why not?*

*Who are you most proud of?*

*What are you excited to see in the future?*

*What untapped or unutilized potential should Enhypen think about honing/developing next?*

Here's mine:

I am a 4-month old engene. I was lucky enough to see them live just a couple of months after deciding to stan. I think it was the highlight of my being a fan, since it's my first time experiencing their concert. What I remember thinking back then was, ""Damn, I should have gotten a standing ticket."" I had fun at the bleachers but I want to feel the ground shaking beneath my feet haha.

Engenes who have seen them in Fate and Manifesto have said that WTL was their most impressive performance yet. I wouldn't know since I have nothing to compare it to. But the show itself was spectacular. The stage was magnificent. I want to inject the song arrangements in my veins. They made the songs more rock. They were fun on stage. They had fun while going around the stadium on the carts. They sustained the energy from beginning to end.

Since it's only been a few months from then to Coachella, I didn't notice much of a difference, except maybe that they became more confident since then. 

The Coachella performance scared me because I felt the immense growth. Like I said, there was not much of a difference. Because they were already excellent then. But it's like they have been consistently fine-tuning their skills, you know? You won't notice the difference when you compare their live performances that are just months apart, but you'll know that something IS different. So I want to know from i-land engenes how much they have grown. 

As for the music, I don't think there was a title track that I disliked. Even though they each gave different vibes, being different genres and all, I liked all of them. I still have a hard time choosing a favorite *(it's Chaconne for now--don't tell the others)* and will end up listing at least 10 *(Chaconne at number 1, obviously)*. It frustrates me sometimes that I don't have enough songs to listen to. I have played the 3-hour Enha playlist to help with the streams of Loose and I still have to wait for a couple more months before they drop another album. Will it be a full album this time? Do they have a full album already? I honestly didn't even bother to check lmao. I just listened to playlists that have all their songs in order of release.

In terms of who I'm most proud of, I'd say it's Jay. I still check YouTube from time to time to watch reactions to his cover video. And every time I watch that cover, I'm taken to a different place and I reprocess the feelings I felt when I first heard it. I say that I am most proud of him, but that doesn't dismiss my pride for the other boys, and I hope that each of them will get more opportunities to showcase their skills or to explore other interests.

Right now, I am excited for next weekend at Coachella. And of course, the next album, and possibly an encore or new tour. I hope they announce the PH stop soon because I'm dying to make freebies again lol

Untapped/unutilized potentials for each member:

\- Sunghoon and Niki solo cover songs. They both have beautiful voices and very very short lines. I want to hear their full covers. Even if it's not in English, if they're not comfortable (but I know they would eat because their tones ughh.)

\- Sunoo, Heeseung, and Jake in more variety shows. Sunoo is a darling in variety shows. Heeseung is naturally funny. And Jake is eloquent. They would represent Enhypen well.

\- Jay in Lee Mujin's service. PLEASE. If not for them, then do it for me Jay lol. I'm not even kidding. This needs to happen.

\- Jungwon as a judge in survival shows. I feel like Jungwon has learned a lot and that he can impart a lot of knowledge to newbies or trainees. As Enhypen members have also said, he gives the most accurate feedback. 

  
Please share yours. I'd love to read them\~",33,14

Enhypenthoughts,1jydr62,2025-04-13 20:00:45,Enchella hate,"Guys i really didn’t want to have to talk about this but unfortunately enhypen are getting hate on almost every platform about coachella.
The first thing i saw was how Sunoo didn’t bring anything to the table and it was a post of him “doing nothing” on stage. I reported and blacked that user.
The next thing i saw was a live about how Enhypen “flopped” at coachella and how it was an “embarrassing” stage that “literally no one attended”. Were we watching the same thing orrr…? I stated my opinion in the comments about how they did so well saying  “you’re just itching to hate on enhypen just because you’re bored and jobless. Don’t make things up in the name of slandering Enhypen. It’s weird and disrespectful.” After that i reported the live and blocked the user. 

On tik tok, i saw someone say that Enhypen “lip synced” and i literally laughed out loud coz wdym? I commented saying “You are literally grasping at straws because how can you put a clip of them performing, clearly not lip syncing, and have the nerve to say that.” I also reported the video and blocked the user.

Someone also said that “Ateez outdid Enhypen at coachella- literally ended those flops” and i commented saying “but that’s where YOU flopped- how can you try and praise one group while putting down another? That’s gonna make atinys look bad and it just makes no sense, putting two groups against each other. Just praise Ateez and leave Enha alone?”  I’m fighting over on tt my thumbs are about to fall off😭😭

Seeing this stuff get me mad and upset like Enha really gave it their all and more just for this response. I don’t care if it’s rage bait or whatever it’s still disrespectful. I just feel like it’s so natural to hate on Enhypen which shouldn’t be the case. They’ve come from so far and have done so well for themselves, achieving a dream they’ve been wanting for who knows how long. I really hope they only see the good comments and videos and let’s hope that next weeks performance shuts the haters up. ",115,89

I knew the boys were gonna do well but they were
WAY BEYOND my expectations. The vocals, the
arrangement, the dance break, the stage
presence everything was mind blowing. This
performance was a tight slap to everyone
underestimating Enha's talent. I'm so proud of
them and I hope  Coachella brings in new exciting
opportunities for them.

But I really meant and am hoping for that they win in those 5 major award shows, just because I want them to feel that they finally reached it in their own home base. Like? I realized that enha's starting point really was damaged with the pandemic ongoing when they debuted because the following boygroups were doing fine on kcharts after the restrictions were lifted. Only this year did the situation finally shines on enha, especially on Heeseung, with his heeseung parade and cloud ramen still viral weeks after they were released. Coachella is just the flint sparking a roaring fire into the recognition of Enhypen as a group. They are popular internationally before this. How about now? Will South Korea finally give enha want they finally deserve? Because I just want to say them, YOU ARE SO LATE TO THIS PARTY! FUCKING JOIN NOW! Like?? I really hope their next album (According to Jungwon, June 5th which is on a Thursday which makes me suspicious but okay) finally gets them many trophies from the music shows that pays them 36 dollars worth and daesang/s from any of the 5 major awards shows, especially GDA which seems to be the most prestigious.

Enhypenthoughts,1jy35vd,2025-04-13 10:37:44,OK I REWATCHED ENCHELLA and here are my thoughts,"**DISCLAIMER:** I’m a very casual baby engene. I’ve always found most of Enhypen visually attractive, and two months ago, I watched *I-LAND* and fell in love!!! I’m also a casual army, but no group other than BTS has hit me as hard as ENHYPEN.

Okay, back to Enchella. When I watched it live, it felt like a fever dream. I was super hyped, dancing, and quietly screaming so my husband wouldn’t think I am a complete weirdo or get too jealous, haha (jk). So, I decided to rewatch it in more detail! And here’s my review:

* **Hee:** Honestly, Hee isn’t my bias. I’ve never seen Enhypen in real life, but I read that in person, he’s much more striking. And now I UNDERSTAND WHY. With other online performances (mostly Korean ones), it’s hard to tell if it’s fully live, but at Coachella, you can hear it. He hits ALL the notes—perfect vocals, dancing, energy, everything. He (and Jay) consistently carried the energy of Enchella, making it fun and energetic to watch. From this performance, I think Hee isn’t just a K-pop top performer—he’s a global top performer. He could perform on the same level as the main stage artists imo, very talented.
* **Jay:** He’s the second one who carried Enchella, imo. I find it wild that he was raised in Seattle and now performs at one of the top festivals in his homeland. I wasn’t a fan of his shirt, though—it gave me dad vibes, haha (I hope only I think this way). But this style kinda suits him, so it's ok :D anyway, I love him and I think his singing/energy was top-notch here too!
* **Sunoo:** Our little sunshine!! I was cracking up during their energetic, intense, sexy performance when Sunoo’s part came, and he was so calm, bright, and smiling like an angel who just came down (even the stage became brighter kinda and the wind was on his hair, like the sun shining on you suddenly haha). I don’t know how he delivers such a relaxed, sunny vibe at this MAJOR FIRST global IMPORTANT performance. love him.
* **Jake:** I was hoping Jake would have a better outfit, but it’s fine. He totally delivered! All good (he’s my bias, haha).
* **Sunghoon:** I swear some Americans might think he’s AI because you know why, no explanation needed. Maybe Sunghoon was a liiiiil bit nervous (?), idk but as everyone, he delivered <3
* **Jungwon:** He was never my bias either, BUT NOW, HOLD UP. He’s my Enchella discovery. His arms, his blond hair flowing in the wind—omg. I used to see him as this cute, diligent guy with big cheeks. I liked his personality and the fact that he is veeeeery hardworking a lot but visually he was not my type. BUT NOW? But now.....I need to revisit my bias list.
* **Ni-ki:** OMG, I’m always hyped to tell my husband/friends his story. He was literally 14, a total cutie, the shortest one (right?), and ALMOST DIDN'T make it into the group (I mean he was really surprised in the ILand finals, right?). AND NOW? He’s the tall king with the deepest voice and this confident, f\*\* boy energy (sorry)—all while being the youngest! If he had not been selected it would be one of the biggest miss of hybe. Enchellawise - I wish he’d shown more of his dance skills here, but his energy was undeniable. I am sorry that I wrote all of this since he’s, like, 11 years younger than me, but his energy is crazy, especially for his age imo.

Thank you for reading this far! Again, I’m new, and sorry if I said anything inappropriate about anyone—no bad intentions at all. I’m just super hyped about the performance and am so happy that it went so GREAT! And I watched briefly some pieces of other kpop bands performing at coachella in the past - and I genuinely think that enhypen did really great. I hope they will celebrate it!",95,15

Like it is so obvious, idek why the other groups fans do not think about how stupid/obvious this is. Why would engenes comment/compare enhypen to another group on their tiktok account? Like we got toxic fans but majority is not like that. 

Rather than just report, they respond with ""why? Blah blah... They always toxic like that, etc"" making the matter even worse/drawing more attention to it. 

Do they really think engenes are that disrespectful/bored? Why would engenes suddenly spam all these groups tiktok accounts in March/April 2025? Like if we wanted to we could've been doing this since what? 2023? 2024? Especially considering enhypen has a big following on TikTok.

Enhypenthoughts,1jxzpus,2025-04-13 06:37:15,"HOW WAS OUR FIRST ENCHELLA, GUYS?!!","I AM BEYOND PROUD.

My god I can't believe how good it was. It was perfect. It was like listening to the studio version of the songs. Everyone was stable. I wanted to keep tweeting but I couldn't look away from the screen. Every time I would want to post something about a certain member, another member shows up on screen and I immediately forget what I was going to say.

I'm blown away. Ni-ki???? Ni-ki looked incredibly cool. Like so effortless. He sounded amazing! And I'm so glad he got to do a dance break and be the center for a few seconds. People deserve to see how incredible he is. 

Heeseung was on a mission tonight lmao. Ad libs were great, as per usual. Stage presence was unparalleled. Vocals???? Istg if I saw him live in that outfit and that hair and saw that performance, I would have gone home a Heeseung stan.

Sunoo wowed me. He's like a breath of fresh air. Everyone was so intense and then he just appeared so effortlessly and has the most stable vocals like he's barely exerting an energy singing all the high notes and it kinda makes me mad that he's so good hahaha

Sunghoon... god. The jawline. The attitude. The vocals. Chef's kiss. Every time he would show his beautiful side profile, I melt like a puddle. He's so... his presense was calmer than the others but it pulls you in. 

Jay was incredible as well. His voice was piercing and gritty. That high note in BTHB??? He's feeling it! I don't normally clap when watching online performances but I couldn't help myself earlier. 

And Jungwon!! Kinda sad that he didn't perform the intro to Future Perfect because that's my favorite but he did so well! His outfit was my favorite. I also noticed that he paced himself in some songs that need to be danced powerfully. I think they all did. They didn't strain themselves too much.

Jake, as always, the hype man. Jake sounded stable as well. Him in Moonstruck! There was one moment where he was singing but the spotlight wasn't on him and I was kinda bummed because his face should have been shown while singing that.

The only let down for me, really, were the outfits. They look great, but it's the normal kind of great, you know? They have better fits in their Tiktok videos. I guess I expected too much from Prada because the way they hyped it, it sounded like they would dress them up in something experimental, unexpected, and unique. But oh well. Their visuals carried, as always.

What are your throughts? I wanna watch it again hahaha. The set was too short. I thought they'd be performing for an hour.

They were really incredible. What a time to be an engene huh.",158,46

Enhypenthoughts,1jxybo3,2025-04-13 05:11:13,Enhypen saved my life,"i became a kpop stan in 2019 and heard of a making of a survival show called ""Iland"". I didn't care much, but I still started watching it and fell in love with a guy with acne. then the little guy debuted, his name was ni-ki 
when enhypen debuted, I just listened to their songs, I liked it but wasn't interested in getting into the fandom 
then, my internship came up. I hate it. no one respected me and I just wanted to rot in bed until the day I passed away. I felt like unliving myself because I just couldn't just take it anymore. but I kept going 
I then realised that the only reason I was feeling like waking up was that I could listen to music on the bus on the way to the internship and by songs I mean enhypen 
more and more I started to listen to those little guys and that became part of me.
I felt that I grew up with them, and more especially ni-ki, my bias, he's basically what I wanted/needed in my childhood. a friend who wouldn't abandon me because I was different (and still am) and I'm so thankful for his existence 
now enhypen is going to perform on Coachella. words can't describe how proud I am for being an engene. I'll repeat myself saying that we grew up together. I can't shake off this feeling, and I'll thank enhypen for being the one group who was there for me when no one else was",37,2

With the other members, they often talk about their thought process on their stage, vocals, dance, things like that. They talk about the things they've practiced or how long they've worked hard on a project. Jungwon gives us barely any details. He shows up, slays on stage, and then just acts cute on Weverse 😂


The only time I heard Jungwon talk about his work was when he wrote the lyrics for Hundred Broken Hearts but the other members hyped his work up more than he did lol. I think he also shared just a few details about his Monster cover?


He's easily one of their strongest dancers and vocalist but he doesn't talk about it. He'll always talk about the other members' talents and contributions first. Is it because he's the leader?


He's such a unique and interesting person. I also love how the members will blame literally anyone else except him when they lose a game, not even if he was responsible for sabotaging them 😂

I did a bit of digging and found out that those accounts follow the same accounts: roblox; 11:11qoutes; vicegandako: potatosaysss. And they follow enhypenasia, enhypenupdates and jwnarchives. 
The possibility that these are bots for a potential attack on enhypen, especially for coachella, is high.

Similar on tiktok. More and more strange accounts started commenting on enhypen-related videos with hate + those same accounts post enhypen ""praise"" (enhypen did it better) on other groups accounts.
Safe to say is we should be prepared for whatever is coming...

Enhypen will do amazing at coachella, so i am not worried about it too much. The best thing we can do is report and block all hate/suspicious accounts. We should focus on posting praise posts and hype up other positive posts about enhypen.",119,19

Tbh I get hesitant talking about Enhypen’s achievements sometimes because antis tend to swarm the moment they sense a boy group on the rise. And that’s definitely what’s happening with Enhypen right now. 


The air just feels different, even on X or Reddit. People are actually promoting them, getting hyped, having discussions, and the excitement is palpable. 


Plus these new stats that just came out today:


>**ENHYPEN Spotify Monthly Listeners:**  
>**8,490,726 (+22,886)**


The 22k is just scratching the surface. Enha's been gaining 10k-30k new listeners *every day*. 


>**Loose' is currently trending at No.7(+1) on YouTube Music Videos in South Korea**


It started out at No.9 in Korea but it went up to No.7. It's just a static, barely moving, *lyric* video but it's still on the rise.


>**DARK BLOOD by ENHYPEN re-enters the Worldwide iTunes Chart at No. 200.**


This also happened **today**. So many Engenes must be so excited for this album to appear on the charts again.


They've also ranked 3rd as the most streamed boy group in Spotify the last few days.


I’m so excited for them. Something really must be in the air because Engines are moving differently now.

Enhypenthoughts,1jtzvus,2025-04-08 01:46:10,Enhypen has been changing its performance over the past few weeks.,"Watching some videos with the Golden disc awards and the tour of Japan I noticed that Enhypen's performance had changed a lot, their stage presence improved A LOT and I felt that instead of putting all their energy into dancing they started to opt for ""light movements"" and well executed (It's not easy to explain) in addition, not only the dancing, but the members too (mainly ni-ki, heeseung and Jake) are focused on sensuality, the vibe of the group has changed completely and it seems like they are about to fully immerse themselves in the concept mature, plus they're probably adapting for Coachella. What do you think?",108,5
Enhypenthoughts,1ju59gn,2025-04-08 06:30:30,They should replace live performances of Blockbuster with Shout Out,"Did y'all see the (probable) spoilers for their Coachella stage on [pinterest](https://ph.pinterest.com/enhypeninthedesert/pins/)? It seems they'll be performing D-D, B-C, Sweet Venom, Bite Me, and Blockbuster.

To be honest I'm really confused about why they keep including Blockbuster in their setlists. I feel like it's not really that much of a fan-favorite, and few people even among the fandom likes it much. Personally I think Shout Out is a better song since its melodies and production has that 2000's-pop punk nostalgia factor that lots of millennials and older Gen Z really like. Blockbuster on the other hand, rarely ever features in fans' top songs from what I've seen.",11,27

For fan calls, is it just you 1:1 and one of them? Is it a group call w/ other fans? (If it's 1:1, those are brave fans, lol.) How long is it usually?

For the in-person fan signs/meets, what's the experience like? Are you allowed to show or give them things? How big is the crowd and how long do you get with each Enhypen member?

And MOST IMPORTANT question: *What is the age range of the ppl who attend?* B/c I'll be honest, I've been checking out Engene fan spaces more and slowly realizing that this fandom is YOUNG AF.

My grandmother has Alzheimer's. She always thinks that her family was killed by an accident. The only one saved in that accident was her grandchild. But she doesn't know where he is. She thinks she is now living in an old age home, and we (family) are employees of an old age home. I always show her some cute videos, and one of the videos was about Sunoo. No idea why she started thinking Sunoo is her grandchild. She begged us; she wanted to know what he is doing now. We just showed all his concert videos, and in one of the videos, when the audience started cheering for Sunoo's name, she started crying. Two days she all did crying for Sunoo. We really don't know what to do.                 
  After that she kept saying she doesn't want to meet Sunoo. You know what she told me? She gives all her prayers, blessings, and happiness for him, what she earned in this life. She also said Sunoo is a pure and kind kid. She doesn't want to bother him and doesn't want to be a burden for him. Maybe my grandmother thinks her life is different from his now. She wants him to be a reason for everyone's happiness. She just requested that if we find Sunoo's photograph, that will be in his room.After that, my grandmother Hobby was just seeing Sunoo's videos. For her happiness When Sunoo's cover song was released, we celebrated like family members—celebrating with fireworks, distributing sweets, etc. On 1 January 2025, she left this world. But she holds Sunoo's photograph in her hand. Our family has lived with my grandmother all these years. But she doesn't even recognize any one of our family members and doesn't know what our names are. But she doesn't have any blood relation, Sunoo. She has only known Sunoo for a few months. But the only one in her last birth was Sunoo. I really wish in the next life my grandmother would recognize me as her grandchild. I really don't know who Sunoo is; I only know him on camera. Because of my grandmother, I already accepted Sunoo as my family member. Sunoo, you are not only my grandmother's happiness but also everyone's happiness. I just wish you stay safe and healthy.

Enhypenthoughts,1jt1mzv,2025-04-06 21:00:48,bring back prepandemic stan culture,"obviously engenes havent experienced prepandemic fan culture bc enha debuted in the pandemic but as a fossil fangirl, i just wished that fangirl culture was as simple as before

these days, there are many types of stans including solo stans ot6 akgaes that get in the fandom spaces and there are also lots of platforms where you can fuel hate

before, none of those were tolerated. there were only 2 categories of fans which are real fans and fake fans. to be a real fan you obviously have to like all the members. u dont like one? FAKE. you only like one? FAKE. you wont be tolerated and while it wasnt a noticeable thing before, i feel like that kept the fandom peaceful and happy.

but now, everyone tolerates these type of stans and at most times, theyre the ones causing ruckus all over the fandom.

if you're a real fan you would be happy for all the members whatever happens right? but now most ppl have these solo stan tendencies embedded within them that if their fav isnt getting the most whether it be line distribution ads or screentime, theyre gonna start complaining of mistreatment. this is a cycle for this fandom too. enhypen has released various of songs wherein all members had varying line distributions (obv, some songs other members get the most and in some they get the least) everytime a song comes out, whichever member who gets the least amt will have a trending tag saying they deserve better. like clockwork. 

while there are times where these complaints are reasonable and worth fighting for. most of the times its just petty. we don't live in utopia, NOTHING will be equal equal. i just think that if you like all the members and appreciate all the members, you wouldnt be complaining as much since you will be happy on whichever member gets the opportunity to shine.

and again, these solos are literally the cause of most problems in this fandom. its bc engenes tolerate them we get more problems.

its been 5 yrs since iland ended its time we stop tolerating solo stan actions",30,6

Both the comments back then and this comment were out of place, yes. But it's all the assumptions and the insane disproportionate backlash that just frustrates me. It's people speaking for Sunoo like he can't speak up for himself that always gets me. And that's always been the thing. If it were coming out of a place of genuine care for him, people wouldn't be dragging the rest of the group. Criticism is fair, warranted even. But shit like ""Sunoo leave the group"" is just. And dragging Riki for, what, the millionth time??? I'm just frustrated over Sunoo being treated like a perpetual victim. Friends don't always say the right things. I certainly don't. And I can't expect them to either because they're, like me, just human. If Sunoo is uncomfortable, I trust that he can talk this out with the members. But this whole narrative that's been going on for YEARS, Sunoo + ENHYPEN instead of ENHYPEN as a whole...is it not tiring? Maybe this whole rant will come off as insensitive or something, but I'm really just tired. I say this often but this is a situation where behind-the-scenes communication is more beneficial, and it's not our place to assume what's happening. But do I think Sunoo's being straight up BULLIED??? No. There's so much evidence out there that proves he's comfortable with the members. Enough to snap back at Jay when they're in the dorms!!! Which was mentioned in a recent interview!!! While I hope Sunoo is okay of course, lashing out at the group and borderline infantalizing Sunoo does...what, exactly?? That's not how you show support. Anyway, April is a big month for them too, so history is repeating itself I guess. Summer 2022 was right before MANIFESTO, and this is right before the talk show performance and Coachella.

Enhypenthoughts,1jsb8fk,2025-04-05 21:18:00,"Some people are being hypocritical and ignorant, fans and non-fans.","(May have grammar errors, sorry 😬)

 Well, since everyone is talking about the hate enhypen is getting, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about some specific things and get this off my chest. Since I usually stay away from fan spaces, I don't know if engenes usually discuss this.

What I want to say may not have much to do with what is happening right now. But as a very quiet engene, I feel I should put my opinions on the internet at least once if it can make people think about it a bit more.

First of all, it's a fact that the people who are throwing violent and exaggerated hate at enhypen now, are people who don't even care about Sunoo and know very little about him... They probably just saw a compilation of him being sassy on tiktok and think that's all he is.

These people (and unfortunately, even so-called engenes) are the first to make fun of him every time he appears doing trying something new or something ""masculine"". As if the way he chooses to express himself and his appearance on any given day were a joke and ""he's trying too much.""

Sunoo has openly mentioned that he doesn't smile all the time, and that people always expect this sunshine image of him all the time and that little by little he is feeling more comfortable showing his real side to the engenes. (He said part of this on weverse magazine.)

I remember when he posted a picture of his hand on Weverse (a picture where his veins were showing) and people's first reaction was to comment things like ""is that really your hand?"" and someone had the audacity to ask ""So you're a man? 😱"". Sunoo saw and responded to these comments, but it's hard to imagine that he wasn't confused and uncomfortable about it. Imagine how that felt.

And then Sunoo got his new haircut now, which looks fabulous and suits him very well ✨️ He posted some pictures when he arrived in the US and guess what? Yep, people not only made fun of his haircut but also someone made weird comments about masculinity. Sunoo saw these comments too, btw.

I say this as someone who has a look that is considered ""boyish, delicate and sensitive"". People are always quick to tell me that I'm ""trying too hard"" whenever I try something different from what they expect of me. But in Sunoo's case, people just don't want him to try anything new.

I've seen all sorts of comments over the years (many of them offensive and disguised as jokes) where people treated him as if he couldn't even try to present a more mature appearance because they prefer the specific image they imagine of him.

I saw a comment here on reddit mentioning that Sunoo has been slowly changing his own style and image. And honestly, this could come from several reasons that I can imagine and many of them are just assumptions. I just hope he's not being pressured to do this, but I doubt it a little since he doesn't seem like the type of person who would change for the sake of others, he's always shown himself to have high self-esteem, of course I don't know him and I don't know what's going on in his head, but how about leaving him alone? If he really wants a buzzcut, piercings and tattoos, go ahead bro, do it. I know he's versatile and looks amazing in any concept, that's what idols do in different eras. They're always changing their look and discovering new sides of themselves.

EDIT 2: The thing is, people always seem to want to control how he should act and feel very attached to just one side of him, you know? That's really tiring to see because he's so much more than that. He's not a persona, he's a person. When he said he wanted a buzzcut and other things, he said he really want it but he thought engenes wouldn't like it. So I just hope he doesn't feel so pressured to stop doing what he wants to do just to make everyone satisfied, really! And another thing, I also see people saying things like ""finally manly Sunoo"" and ""finally he became masculine like the other members"" which is also unnecessary and even blatantly homophobic! There are two sides acting in the extreme without seeing the real problem, which is the control they want to have over him.

What I've noticed about the comments about his feminine side is that people (fans and non-fans) often don't know how to compliment him and show their admiration without using slurs, derogatory words that could offend him or assume his sexuality, which, for god's sake, leave this man alone because this information is none of our business.

What bothers me about all this is that it's so hard for people to see their hypocrisy, when they're pretending to care about Sunoo on twt when they're the same people who are out there making fun of him and trying to control how he should act and then say that Enhypen are the bad guys.

Where were these saints of morality when they were spreading rumors and trying to potentially out him? Most people used it to laugh and say ""fork found in the kitchen"", ""water is wet"", no one cared about him AS A PERSON.

Please...

I just want him to have the freedom to be authentic and show new sides of himself with confidence without these people having to comment unnecessary things all the time. This goes for both the fandom and the haters of enhypen on twt who are currently calling enhypen ""bullies"" but who don't look at themselves and what they comment about him since he debuted.

If you're going to support him, do it fully. Not just when it's convenient or when it fits the image you made up in your head.

Enhypenthoughts,1jrj0hk,2025-04-04 20:29:54,Just a perspective about the whole hate train thing,"as someone who has been a fan since iland’s very first episode and was on twitter during the massive hate train they experienced in 2022 i just want to give you guys some reassurance and a little perspective.

a big part of why enhypen is so easily misinterpreted to this day lies on not only how guidable stantwt is but specially on the fact that they want to be. 
people on these communities use such hate train opportunities to grasp a sense of belonging and showcase their morals, as they’ll be highly agreed with and have their thoughts validated, even if based on untruths.

manifesto era situation happened the way it did not only because of a comment that was, in fact, unnecessary, but specially because it triggered people to remember about the very first hate train they had in 2021 about the same issue. it also lasted long because soon after that clip blew up they released ‘pass the mic’, which was not well received as a track either. 

all we have this time is the trigger. not an offensive comment or unnecessary joke, only the trigger effect that reminded stantwt of everything they had seen before and that the members never repeated in all these years. they are mad about the past while projecting it into the present, so as an effort to show they still don’t agree with such issues and elevate their moral once again, a problem needs to be created. and so they did.

but something i learned still in 2022 was that we don’t always have to follow what others claim to condemn. as a fat woman i saw that issue as something that people had the right to be upset about and worry about sunoo as well, yes, but that was blown way out of proportion and worse, created out of hypocrisy, because the backlash and fat-phobic comments fat engenes that had chosen to keep stanning enhypen got at that time was no joke.

so guys, don’t worry too much. people want validation and they get a lot when speculating about enhypen’s dynamics. 
and even if we want enhypen to thrive, grow and gain more fans, maybe it’s time for us to stop fighting for any type of validation or praise to come from these communities.

and even if sunoo was offended the members will deal with this amongst themselves....even during their debut they have all fought with sunghoon due to differences but their friendship became stronger after...hence TRUST ENHYPEN and leave this to them..fans musnt get involved in family issues....

someone said the members have bullied jay and sunoo since the debut so here r my contradictions to shut them up :

JUNGWON : wonnie loves his sunoo hyung soo much he has often said that sunoo is the only member who listens to him and is so gratefull to sunoo...wonnie is also THE FIRST to hug sunoo whenever he cries...and he is jay's lifeline yall- jay said it himself even tho wonnie teases jay...they both look at eo sooo lovingly...

HEESEUNG : this boy just minds his work and leaves...and these days he rarely takes part in teasing...i strongly believe this is due to backlash that the members have gotten earlier for teasing sunoo thats why i see more members not interacting with sunoo much...heeseung seems more cautious than the others

JAY : man even sunoo teases jay by calling him grandpa..thats just how they r- we all know how much uncle jay loves his pocketz nephews..dont come for my hanlimz- ill get pissed

JAKE : jake teases jay a lot but jay takes it lightly and laughs it off...jay has even said that he wants to make the members laugh....and abt sunoo....jake (during some live) has said ""hey stop it sunoo doesnt like it when u tease him"" jake has always been a caring person...since their debut only true engenes will kno how much jake values being nice and polite...he is also the fav hyung to the maknaes for a reason

SUNGHOON :

he is the member who teases others the most but comeon none can take shots against jay...jay has also sushed sunghoon once for making a joke during some outdoorcookout vid if ppl are offended by sunghoon i guess they will offended by jay too...none of th ENHYPEN members r spared fromt heir teasing they all go neck in neck..their literal love language is teasing

even tho sunghoon teases sunoo he has said ""i tease u cuz it is the joy to my life"" to sunoo OFFCAM sunoo shared this with fans while smiling brightly...we all kno sunghoon adores his hubae soo much..even if they have differences they will sort it out cuz they love eo

NIKI :

jay has a soft spot for the maknae and even if he is teased he always looks at niki like ...ahh my son has grown sooo much...

now lets come to niki and sunoo

during the debut niki was only 14, alone and far away from his family in a country where he barely knew the language, he had cultural differences with the rest of the members and often seemed left out during all of this he always stuck to his sunoo hyung...he was scared to sleep alone so he used to sleep with sunoo...yes niki does tease sunoo but he loves him soo much...niki got severe hate for teasing sunoo during the debut days..toxic netz were sending him death threats and said such bad stuff like ""this is why ur father doest care abt u"" and much worse things that i cant stomach to say...he didnt deserve it...niki adores his sunoo hyung sooo much...and if sunoo was really upset with niki he can just say so and niki will not repeat it...cuz niki is the one who NEEDS sunoo in their relationship not the other way around...

nowww ppl of the internet STOP hating on ENHYPEN cuz this is just how they r if they have problems they will deal with it STOP poking ur nose into the issue....

ENGENES BE SMART AND STOP SPREADING HATE!!! INSTEAD LETS HYPE ENCHELLA!!

But PLEASE put that energy into streaming and posting good things to and about Enhypen! Whenever I see something that upsets me I just post something cute or fun on weverse. If you like content creation please make a cute video or two showcasing their good/sweet sides. That way when people start to check out the group during/after Enchella they will see positivity rather than chaos. My wish is that true Engenes could drown out the hate with positivity <3

(not to worry you all but because I want to stress how important our support is) When I first joined the fandom, unfortunately the haters were very loud so I actually believed some of the things they said about them. I became a fan because of Sunoo so you can imagine what I was feeling in the beginning. It was only by watching their videos and through fanmade content I could actually get to know the guys and how sweet they are. So please don't be discouraged! I think their true fans will come to know to know them one way or another <3",48,13
Enhypenthoughts,1jrnmww,2025-04-04 23:46:53,Where does this rumor come from ?,"I hope you do not take this question as me being direspectful to ni-ki, I’m just genuinely curious to know where it came from and I only started stanning Enhypen very recently. 

As some of you may know enhypen twitter is a real blood bath right now but I’ve noticed that to insult Ni-ki a lot of people accused him of being a closeted gay. This happened multiple times. Even before that I would sometimes see people bring this up but I have no idea where this come from. And he’s the only member that get accused of this (other than Sunoo), which is weird because Ni-ki is the most masculine member of enhypen and he has never hinted at his dating preferences as far as I’m aware.. So it must come from somewhere, right ? Is there something that I missed ?",13,18

Enhypenthoughts,1jrl21i,2025-04-04 21:56:24,Conspiracy theories,"I became an Enhypen fan during the ""Romance: Untold"" era. 

Most of my friends became Engene (Enhypen fans) after watching the survival shows ""I-Land"" or during the ""Orange Blood"" era.

Here's a thought I have that might sound like a conspiracy theory!

(First of all, I'm saying this without any bad intentions. I just want you all to understand what I mean.)

Based on what I've seen from other Engene, I think some of SM stans like Enhypen. They said that Enhypen's style is reminding to them the SM's style  especially in music (partially).

People I talked to agreed that Enhypen's songs are good, and some of their songs remind them of older songs from that SM group. 

I'm not bring up specific groups to avoid misunderstandings!

What do you all think about this?

And *holy fuck.* 

That song is hauntingly gorgeous.

But that’s not what made me emotional. It’s the fact that Moonstruck so perfectly encapsulated the feeling of young love. Of starting to fall in love.

the lyrics ‘you make me go crazy over you’… that explains perfectly how I felt about my most recent ex. When I first met him. Fell in love with him.

I fell in love hard and fast for the first time with him. But we took it slow. ’we can take it slow.’

i dont understand a lot of the rest because I can’t speak Korean/I mishear a lot of shit… but DAMN. The way that Moonstruck makes me feel: nostalgic, upset, glad I experienced something this deep, and hope for the future.

sorry for the rant. I just love this song so much.",55,6

It took me so long to realize that ""Loose"" is in english and honestly? I don’t mind. I think I get a little giggle when I hear them sing in english.


I know some fans get upset when their faves release a lot of songs in english instead of korean, saying it’s not Kpop anymore. But I’ve never felt that way about Enhypen?


In fact, I really enjoy their english covers and the english version of XO. And ""Loose"" sounds like an up and coming banger.


I actually look forward to Ni-Ki doing an english cover or if Jake and Jay have their solo projects.


Anyway, what do you guys think about them singing in english? I’m not sure if this is an unpopular opinion among Engenes but I really like it.

Enhypenthoughts,1jqb07s,2025-04-03 08:11:48,Just cried while watching “Chamber 5” on iland,"Hi guys! 

I’ve been a fan of Enhypen for two years now as they are my sister’s ult group. She got me into them and they are now one of my favourite groups too! 

She has watched iland and has been asking me to watch it for awhile too now, but whenever I become a fan of a group formed from a survival show, I always find it so hard to watch said show after the fact because I end up crying… a lot. 

Anyway, she got me in the end, and we’ve been watching one ep daily and I have INDEED cried a lot. Whenever I see one of the boys, and how little they were, my heart immediately is pulled at. 😞 

And today, we got to ep 11 and five of them performed “chamber 5” and while my sister has shown me the song before, it was so different than actually seeing that version of them performing it. 💔 it was just so HOPEFUL AND JOYOUS AND FILLED WITH THEIR DREAMS AND AMBITIONS AAAH IM GONNA CRY AGAIN. LIKE WITHIN THE FIRST TEN SECONDS I WAS CRYING, THEY WERE JUST SO ADORABLE AND GIVING IT THEIR ALL AND THEY DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH WILL COME THEIR WAY, HOW ALL THEIR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN REPAID. IT’S LIKE THEY TOOK OUT THEIR HEARTS AND PUT THEM ON THAT STAGE FOR ALL TO SEE, FOR THEIR WISHES TO BE HEARD, AND HEARD THEY HAVE BEEN!!!

Anyway I love Enhypen.

(Side note, I also get really anxious watching these shows even though I know who has debuted, I’m like shaking for them 😞)",43,10
Enhypenthoughts,1jr7wwp,2025-04-04 11:37:17,I need more facts,"I've been into Enha not so long. I like to stan them because of their music, discography, and visuals.

But some disturbing things cross my mind. So please correct me, and educate me with actual facts. I will share some of my opinions.

1- There is no chemistry between them - I saw some friendships like Jay and Jungwon, 02s < They are goofy sometimes but not as the whole group. (But I like the fact they don't force their unaligned chemistry) 

2 - Some members are masculine enough that may seem disturbing to sunoo (or) Sunoo is a bit sensitive. 

3 - Sunoo said that Enha is very important to him < but I feel like it's just for PR and I can feel it more by watching zip daesang. 

My friend who has been engene since the I-land era told me that there are lots of solo stans. And the group didn't align well because of the internal fan wars. < is that true

She even suggested to watch I-Land to get to know all the drama. But I wonder if it's been 5 years since they were formed and their behaviors might have changed, right? 

But in the end, I like their music and performance a lot. So I will going to support them in the future. I don't need any forced bromance from any group to get the reason to stan! But I feel some irritation from the facts I've provided. So, my fellow engenes, please correct me and give me some facts and data.

here’s mine
	1.	Given Taken
first song i ever heard from them. funny part is i didn’t even know it was enhypen at the time. i got hooked after watching the R U NEXT performance. before that i was only into girl groups but this one cracked the door open for me
	2.	Criminal Love
banger. no explanation needed. it just goes hard
	3.	Fatal Trouble
the dance practice made me love it even more. the choreo is insane. the song on its own is great but with the performance it’s next level
	4.	Lucifer
i’m praying Loose gives this exact vibe.
	5.	Blossom
a literal masterpiece. makes me wanna lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling
	6.	Blind
grew on me in the best way. has that tunnel at night headlights blurring kinda feel. like that scene in perks of being a wallflower where they feel infinite
	7.	Fever
the classic. it’s sexy it’s smooth it’s iconic
	8.	Scream
the bridge alone makes it top 10. one of their best bridges ever
	9.	No Doubt
that jungwon sunghoon sunoo verse is just so clean. i rewind it every time
	10.	Moonstruck
so pretty it deserved a full bridge. like why didn’t they give it one. it was right there

**Jay:**

*- Over You by Daughtry*

*- Wish You Were Here by Neck Deep*

For the whole group, I kinda want them to cover any 5SOS song. Maybe *Lie To Me* or *Teeth* (chorus HeeJay would eat) or *Valentine* (it's moody like their other songs). Basically, anything from Youngblood (Deluxe).

Most singers from this list have raspy voices, so I also went for the vibe of the song or how I hear a member's interpretation of the notes when they sing them.

\**my favorites for each member*

***Jungwon***

**- The Final Countdown by Europe** *(because the vibe reminds me of Future Perfect's intro for some reason)*

**- Woman by John Lennon \***

**- Truly Madly Deeply by Savage Garden \***

**- Ironic by Alanis Morissette \*** *(Please tell me you can hear what I'm hearing)*

\--

***Heeseung***

**- Africa by Toto**

**- Every Breath You Take by The Police \*** *(can you imagine him singing that bridge???)*

**- The Lady in Red by Chris de Burgh \*** *(it just fits his vibe)*

**- If You Don't Know Me By Now by Simple Red**

\--

**Jay**

**- You Give Love a Bad Name by Bon Jovi** *(tbh I want Jay to cover every Bon Jovi song available. I just need to restrain myself from putting everything here lol)*

**- Iris by Goo Goo Dolls \*** *(This is my favorite song. I would combust if he drops a cover of this)*

**- Closing Time by Semisonic**

**- To Be With You by Mr. Big \***

\--

**Jake**

**- Don't Stop Believin' by Journey**

**- Don't Dream It's Over by Crowded House \***

**- Heaven by Bryan Adams \*** *(as much as I think inspirational songs fit Jake, I can imagine his voice from the very first note of this song)*

**- Don't Speak by No Doubt** *(It just so happened that he has accummulated all the Don'ts lmao)*

\--

**Sunghoon**

**- Still Loving You by Scorpions**

**- More Than Words by Extreme \*** *(the amount of falsetto this song has will be perfect for Sunghoon's voice)*

**- Wicked Game by Chris Isaak**

**- White Flag by Dido \***

\--

**Sunoo**

**- Right Here Waiting by Richard Marx \*** *(Sunoo would be great at extending notes like in ballads, so I feel like this will be perfect for him)*

**- Hungry Eyes by Eric Carmen**

**- Breakfast at Tiffany's by Deep Blue Something \*** *(I can imagine Sunoo jumping around during the chorus and still sounding stable lol)*

**- Jumper by Third Eye Blind**

\--

**Ni-ki**

**- I Wanna Know What Love Is by Foreigner**

**- Don't You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds** *(with the movie's main guy's fit for the performance ughhh)*

**- With or Without You by U2 \***

**- She's So High by Tal Bachman \*** *(I know Ni-ki can do those high notes)*

**- Creep by Radiohead \***

since no one has talked abt it yet i wanted to let everyone know in advance so no mishaps take place the yg leaker is all a huge scam and i hope no engenes fall for the rumors....

context : someone by the name of yg leaker is active on discord saying that they were fired from yg cuz they leaked jennie and taehyung pics (nothing is confirmed) they have mentioned that they have huge terabytes of info and dirt on seven companies(including big 3 and hybe)....now im not going to mention all of it if ur interested to know more abt this scandal just search it i dont want the post to be deleted cuz of links anyways the stuff that this person released upuntil now are unreleased mvs, demos, covers etc..they have also made comments abt a few idol's sexuality....

SUNOO being one of them and he claimed that sunoo is mistreated by his members and the company over it

ppl have pointed out that most of the stuff that this person released was already dug up by fans in the past and that they r only trying to make a fuss with no real proof...mainly all the things they said dont add up...and ppl spectulate that this might be a strategy to cover up ksh's case.........yeah.....dont ask i have no idea whats going on anymore....and even if u see some other things that this person said......like they said that jenkai broke up cuz jennie dumped kai for being bisexual...like bro what??

my take on this.....they have bashed many idols but why is enhypen one of them and why right NOW......... DUH cuz ENCHELLA is nearby this could just be a corporate scandal for many reasons and ONE of them could be..... to do something bad before coachella to hinder enhypen's success and im not speaking as a ""jealous"" engene...this just makes sense as they have targeted other current prominent figures like jennie blackpink nct kai baemon bts and many more.....

their startegy : enha will loose fans if sunoo was mistreated hence lesser supporters at coachella.....

bro engenes aint falling for this unless we get proper proof they just want to exploit sunoo solo stans and make them believe that sunoo is mistreated by the members......cuz sunshines(sunoo solo stans) have brought up the issue of sunoo being mistreated BY THE COMPANY many times before....i understand this as an ot7 i too will give up on enhypen if this is true BUT ITS NOT TRUE we have no confirmations

It looks like he's helping them rehearse? Take this with a grain of salt but that's what it look like.


I can't believe they didn’t air this in the show. It highlights just how selfless Ni-Ki is. He was in the DNA team but he was also helping the Fake Love team (who ultimately won). 


He was only 14 at the time, yet he was already so kind and selfless. This just adds another reason to love Ni-Ki and how misunderstood he was back then.

2. sometimes there are different members talking at once and i try to figure out who said what, and what wasn’t included in the subtitles since translators usually just sub the main person talking 
3. something really funny/precious happens so i replay it 3 more times because in order to process the super cute or funny thing that just happened 
4. and when that funny/cute thing happens, i replay it 7+ more times to see EACH of their reactions (so sometimes i really appreciate those youtube shorts engenes uploading a compilation of all the different members reactions to sunoo for example)
5. i have to pause and read subtitles 

in the beginning, i wondered why its taking so long to catch up on their stuff especially as a new engene im trying to learn as much as i can but then i realize i would consume such little content in DAYS during whatever  free time i DO have to watch them! its getting ridiculous 😂 like i love that that probably means i never have to fear about running out of content and i can go ahead and do enhypen marathons! but at the same time i am OVERWHELMED by HOW much stuff i have to catch up on! all their interviews, behind making for all their mv, en connect, en o clock etc! i’m not even done with i-land yet! 😭😭 even worse because i stanned them so late i have to catch up on what i missed! i’m not used to having such plentiful content bc the groups i’ve stanned before did NOT do it like this 😂 we were lucky to have 3 seasons of a show with just 8 ep each but with enhypen, their en-o clock is like 100+ episodes, WHAT?? anyway i guess that just means ill be eating good..

Enhypenthoughts,1jlwe2o,2025-03-28 15:29:55,Jay's new cover song makes me feel secured as a fan.,"I keep thinking about this all day. I posted a comment on one of the posts in kpop Reddit asking for our favorite B-sides and I listed songs from Enhypen and it was obvious that they didn't like the songs, but I didn't mind. In my head, I thought... okay. They said they would be harsh and that they would roast the songs we commented. And even when they showed bias to other groups and other songs, I didn't mind because I didn't feel the need for their validation.

And Jay's cover just solidified that for me.

People can call them bad singers and I wouldn't budge because I can hear how well they sing.

People can call them stiff and I wouldn't care because I know how well they dance.

People can call their songs mid but it's okay because I like their songs.

People can call them boring and I wouldn't cry about it because I know they are funny and interesting.

I know liking a group heavily depends on the person checking them out. If they don't like Enhypen, that's fine. They are missing out on a lot. But it's fine because ***I*** am not missing out on anything. I am well fed. I am happy.

The group I stan is great.

Everyday, I discover something about them that makes me like them even more. And as a fan, that is all I need.",166,18

Enhypenthoughts,1jlvm32,2025-03-28 14:54:10,What are your stand out moments of Enhypen members in i-land?,"What scenes from i-land make the members of Enhypen highlighted in a good way that resonates with you? If you could give one for each member, that would be great but if not, you can just pick one for your bias or a random member.

Mine would be the following:

**Jay -** What really stood out to me was when Jay kept raising his hand and he kept getting rejected but he still kept going until he got a part. It showed me his determination. When I was new to Enhypen and I didn't know their personalities (I was still just getting into them when I watched i-land), I thought Jay was someone who values his pride. Like when he didn't get the part he wanted the most, I expected him to just quit to save face. But I was pleasantly surprised when he kept raising his hand. Being rejected multiple times is humiliating. He also said it himself. We all saw how humiliated he was. But he still kept going. I really admire that about him.

**Sunghoon -** While Sunghoon should be praised for his hardwork as well, the moment that stood out to me was when they were all hanging out in the lounge (?) area and they asked him if he thinks he is the most handsome participant in the show and he said yes. Sunghoon strikes me as someone who is sure of himself. He can take compliments well. He knows he is good-looking. He knows he is good at this or that. He is honest about that but he never came across as arrogant. It's like he is telling you how he sees himself and that is so refreshing, being in the midst of idols who shy away from compliments a lot.

**Sunoo -** I love the part where Sunoo approached Sunghoon in the kitchen and told him he is cuter (than Jake, if I remember correctly?) and that he wants to be friends. I admire him for putting himself out there and just asking for something that he wants. Sunoo is someone who has a lot of self love and his own self's biggest cheerleader. He is an extrovert, right? But he doesn't seem overly confident. He sometimes appears bashful. It takes courage to ask. Most of the times, things won't be handed to you just because you think you deserve it. So I like that he is asking for things that he wants to get, even friendship.

**Heeseung -** He didn't stand out to me in i-land that much, despite being dubbed the ace. But that's kinda what I like about him. Even though people have already put him on a pedestal even before the show started, Heeseung never ones seemed like he thinks he deserves all the praise and that everyone is beneath him. I think it's also because he knows it comes with a lot of expectations and he didn't want to disappoint anyone. But he is loved because he is like that. And seeing their contents from 2020 up to now, I'm glad that he hasn't changed at all. He may be more assertive and sure of himself now, but he would still choose to keep the peace than step on someone's toes.

**Ni-ki -** I like Ni-ki's stubbornness in i-land. He knows what he wants. He knows how to achieve it. He wants people to do things a specific way in order to reach it. I never saw his bluntness as rudeness, but I did think he had some growing up to do back then. I like how being stubborn helped keep his artistry pure. I was team Ni-ki when he made a different move during a team challenge and K got mad haha. I understood where both sides were coming from. It's a team challenge so everyone has to do well, but they're also individually graded so Ni-ki wanted to stand out.

**Jake -** I don't remember a lot of specific moments, but I love Jake's growth in i-land the most. I think he's the one who had so much growth from the first episode. One moment that I remember from him was when he was practicing for something, but then someone asked him to teach them the dance (can't remember if it's EJ or Nicholas or someone else), and he started teaching them (I'm remembering correctly, right? It was Jake who taught them?). Anyway, yeah. It should be a given that he has a lot of potential since he beat 499 aspirants to get into i-land, but he really was commendable there.

**Jungwon** \- I remember him always getting the 3rd part in the dance challenges. He was almost always in the middle, the safe parts. Not too high to have too much expectations, and not too low to feel bad about himself, but almost always in the happy middle. One of my favorite moments was when he first came in and everyone was adoring his visuals. He is cute. He is cute but he is capable. And I think from i-land up to now, that's how Jungwon has always been. At first glance, you'd see him as someone youthful and adorable, but like a duck floating on water, you won't see how much weight and responsibility he carries because he always has a bright smile on his face.

I think I'm lucky enough to come across i-land years after Enhypen has been formed. I didn't grow too attached to the other participants because I already know the winners. I didn't get to experience the trauma. It was pretty upsetting on some parts, but I would love to watch it again some time. To me, it showed me a glimpse of how the members would be in the future, how they are as people, and how they would grow to become the artists they are now.

(I'm also a bit sentimental because of [Jay's cover of Always](https://youtu.be/8oHZYE_0Ndk?si=6kAiJNf5DVboVmJU) just slapped me hard with nostalgia. Watch it if you haven't seen it yet. Let's all rave about it.)",75,14

Enhypenthoughts,1jll9c9,2025-03-28 03:53:12,What are your predictions on what the comeback’s concept would be like?,"As far as I know, one of the members said that their comeback will be in May, a month after Coachella, and what do you guys think would be the theme or concept for the next comeback?",24,13
Enhypenthoughts,1jlibdq,2025-03-28 01:24:52,"What songs would you create an MV for, and how will it look like?","My favourite thing to do is listen to a song and imagine my own music video! Also when I listen to MV-less songs, I would imagine what visuals would go well with the song. This applies across genres and artists, and this time let's talk about enhypen.

Music videos I would create (for songs with no MV):

1. TEETH - the song is about dissatisfaction with life, a newfound obsession, and... teeth. However, I tend to prioritize the musical style over story/lyrics, so I wanna highlight the amazing phonk(!!) element of this track. And the first thing that comes to mind when I think of phonk sound is gen Alpha's TikTok edits of ""PSL gods"" and celeb/anime/movie characters' badass 99999+ aura moments. These two are intimately tied to the ""manosphere"" and people's superficial ideas about what constitutes as being ""cool"" (i.e., ""looksmaxxing""). Being unsatisfied about one's own seemingly mundane life (""sick of my life"") and the obsession to attain ""aura"" by following internet guide to looksmaxxing. That reminds me of ""mewing"", which reminds me of jaw placement, and ... teeth placement. It all circle backs! LOL

So what will I do with these ideas? The mv will start with the members dressing up as regular teen boys. They will be underdressed and given little to no makeup. The point here is to make them look as regular as possible. They will also be doing gen alpha stuffs: playing games using full set consoles. Doing push ups and trying to grow muscles. Looking at the mirror to check their fangs (teeth). Using discord while wearing headphones. Eating a gaudy pack of chocolate bar (have you seen MrBeast's chocolate bar??). Producing their own beats using a software. Scrolling through stereotypical TikTok contents (with all the TikToks videos being played by the members themselves). Reading reddit. I will include a quick scene of a member (say, Jungwon) opening r/enhypen, reading a post (""Who is the most handsome member?"") rapidly downvoting comments that mention the name of any othet members, and posted an absurd and unexpected response to the post (e.g., ""obv its jyp smh""). 

Then, on the first chorus and hook, the MV will suddenly cut to scenes from the game they play -- which will be an RPG, Souls-like game. The visuals will give a nod to their dark moon lore and include references from that story. In the next section, the scenes will shoe the members in Berserk-style animation. I know they have their own manhwa characters in the webtoon -- these can be incorporated, but the art style will be adjusted a teeny bit to look more like a shonen/seinen than a shoujo. Visually, the MV will follow the style of New jeans' ""New Jeans"" mv -- an homage to the digital world and the Internet, crossing multiple art styles and habitus, from animation to beat-making software. 

THE MOST CRUCIAL task of this mv will be to highlight the bridge of this song, where they go almost full phonk, and even made a good reference to TikTok's ""slowed and reverbed""-style and ""sped up"" audios of phonk songs -- by slowing down the tempo and reverting it to normal (speeding up). Amazing! So what will I do with that? I will make references to enhypen's viral TikTok edits by actually putting those edits/footages for the slowed down phonk part. I will also make exclusive anime-style videos of the members, and make them look like as if they were edits or taken from an actual running anime. When the song turns to ""Sick of my life..."" part, we'll go back to the scenes portraying them as regular teenage boys. But this time they will be shown... dissatisfied eith their life. They want to grow up, grow out of the digital cocoon and boyhood. So they put down their phones, chocolate, consoles, they stopped mewing. They want to grow out of their ""baby teeth"". And on the final chorus, they will be shown dressed in the exact costumes their anime characters wore, and danced to the song's choreography, with shots following the style of regular kpop mv. This will be a surprise as this will be the only scene that features dancing in this MV.

And in the last post-chorus, they will dress up as the characters in the game they played, this time with real swords, and shot in real castles. The contrast between the graphic of the game and anime in earlier shots and the cinematic, HQ quality of the ""real"" shots will intrigue the viewers.

2. CHACONNE - because the main topic of this song is about a dance, the MV will focus on that -- dancing. Thus the MV will follow the style of Sia's Chandelier. They will perform a crazy lyrical dance routine and thats all. Imagine Sunghoon's solo dance scene in Drunk Dazed but this time make it full song. However, the song is also about awareness of one's arrogance and how it isolates them from the rest of the world. I will interpret that arrogance as akin to unrepentant sinning -- you're aware of your sin but unwilling to receive criticism or advices to repent, and it isolates you from the world as you sink deeper into your own sinfulness and the condemnation of your own conscience.

Thus, the MV concept will be: because they assume they can live forever, being vampires, they're all arrogant -- they refuse to change their ways when it comes to the 7 deadly sin. Yet, their conscience keeps telling them this is not right, and they will experience internal conflict/dilemma -- whether to die to their ego or die to their conscience. This story about their dilemma with sins will be told through dance.

So, if I were the MV producer, I'll rent a Victorian mansion and have each member dance in separate rooms, transforming into another member as they pass through one door to transition to different rooms -- akin to the Dark Blood MV Trailer where they all can merge into a person and also unmerge into separate individuals when one dies. They will dance while interacting with the properties of each room. E.g. one in the library, the other in the bathroom, another in the bedroom, dining room, home office room, dressing room, and ending up in the backyard garden where tombs are present. We will not see them dance together. Each room and choreography will represent a different story of agony/struggle with sin.

For example, dining room will represent gluttony. I will have Jake in for that scene, telling the story about addiction to comfort from drinking/eating. This is inspired by him being drunk in a Prada event LOL. He will dance using the wine glasses, doing an actual drinking as part of the choreography, dancing with knife and fork, etc. Then he will open the door to the next room and transform into another member. Say, he transforms into Heeseung as he enters the bedroom. Here, Heeseung's issue will be lust. He will dance with a standing coat/hat hanger as if that is a person. Also, dancing inside the sheets and blankets on the mattress. Ni-ki in the dressing room; pride. He'll be dancing intimately with his reflection in the mirror and with his collection of luxury clothes, jewelries, and shoes. There will also be random occasional cuts showing when the mirror does not show Ni-ki's reflection. This functions for two things: a nod to the lore that he's a vampire; and symbolically, it works as a reminder that prideful people are not literally in love with his reflection, but with their IDEAS about their reflection -- their perception about their image, and imagination about how our image is perceived by others. And so on and so forth for greed, wrath, envy, and sloth for the remaining members.

I want the final scene to end with Sunghoon, representing wrath, dancing in the backyard garden. The backyard will have a frozen mini pool and he can flaunt a bit of his retired ice skating skills there. Nevertheless, the VERY final scene will show Sunghoon lying on the backyard cemetery, above an empty patch, while facing the night sky and the full moon, in the same lying position he did in Drunk Dazed -- exhausted and collapsed. He is tired of fighting the spiritual battle. Then, the scene will fade into the morning, where Sunghoon disappeared and the patch he lied on top of has turned into a grave. There will be 7 flowers laid on top of it. This final scene will act as a memento mori reminder -- a somber message to the viewers to ""remember that you will die"". Either your ego dies or your conscience dies -- but remember that one will have to die. And one more thing: you must/will die, physically, one day. Nobody is a literal vampire. Not even enhypen.

Sweet and romantic (in the artistic/musical sense) with just a hint of grounding melancholy. Also, I'm totally absolutely biased because he was such major player in the concept film (main character/antagonist Sunoo believer I'll die on that hill), but I think some of his best vocal performance is on that album. Mortal and Orange Flower (You Complete Me) especially. I always fall flat when it comes to vocal description so you'll have to forgive me here but it's so. It's warm. His voice is warm like the whole spring vibe of the album. And his range is so cool. Mortal when he goes from high register to mid register like that??? Augh. Love him !!! Other places his vocals stand out for me:

• SHOUT OUT. Specifically the ending. Not just because of how good he sounds, but I find it so cool that their first encore/closing song ends with Sunoo, the last member to be added to I-LAND's final lineup and the member to complete what we now know as ENHYPEN. And he just sounds so good 😭 he has such a driving energy behind his vocals in those last two lines I adore it so much.

• Royalty. His ""It's not little by little"" scratches my brain like crazy I don't even understand it. Me when the function has sunjake matching parts 😍😍😍 (Mortal and Royalty)

I know there are more common places to mention like DARK BLOOD (Sacrifice and Chaconne more specifically) but the ones listed above hit me nicely 🥰 my favorite Sunoo parts",43,3

He was also the member that people outside of the fandom knew the most. Now it’s been years since I've tuned in but I've been slowly working my way back into the fandom and I've noticed some things have changed. First of all the members seemed to be pretty equally loved by the fandom now which is nice.  And I've noticed that Jungwon, Sunghoon, Jay and Sunoo in particular seem to be very popular especially Jungwon on Tiktok, however it seems as if Ni-Ki has lost the title of the most popular member, in fact I see the other members being talked about more than him within the fandom, even on Tiktok, I see a lot of viral videos of Sunoo and Jungwon but not of him. Am I right to assume he went down in the ranks of the most popular members in Enhypen ?",0,16
Enhypenthoughts,1jiwyl6,2025-03-24 18:51:13,What Enhypen song is each member?,"Enhypen's discography only but don't think of vocals or line distribution. Think of which Enhypen song each member is that matches their **personality or vibe**.


**Jungwon** - Orange Flower. It's a warm and cute song. It reminds me of healing which is what Jungwon does when he goes on Weverse. 

**Heeseung** - Fever. I could get lost in this song which is what Heeseung makes me feel like because of his magnetism.

**Jay** - Karma. He don't give a f and will do whatever he likes. The energy matches his personality too.

**Jake** - Moonstruck. It's a cozy song that makes you feel safe which is how the members and Engenes feel around Jake.

**Sunghoon** - Sacrifice. It feels like a competitive and intense song with a cool vibe like Sunghoon.

**Sunoo** - Polaroid Love. I tried so hard not to pick this song for Sunoo but it's really him 😭 He's a bright energy.


**Ni-Ki** - Brought the Heat Back. The song is so camp and fashionable, much like Ni-Ki and it has a lot of texture, similar to how he dresses.


You can do 1 member or all! It'd be be more fun if you provide a description.

(p.s i don’t wanna offend anybody)
first i wanted to say that i don’t stan enhypen so there is no biasness in my opinion. i just casually watch some of their videos/clips on my tiktok fyp & also watched i-land

since i-land, i’ve always thought jungwon is the best at dancing, & i know all the members are good especially niki but he always stood out to me in any dance clips, performances, etc that i’ve watched. his movements are so fluid, sharp, smooth & he never ever misses a beat😭.  you can see it clearly in their fever mv

i always wondered why niki is crowned as the best/main dancer of enhypen, and yes i know he’s really really great at dancing too but imo jungwon stands out more to me

in some instances he’s just able to stick to ceilings upside down etc but he also can do mind control/hypnosis? like which one is it? or both?? 

also is sunghoon’s character’s (solon) power just that he’s half vampire half werewolf?

Enhypenthoughts,1jikdwm,2025-03-24 07:28:21,Enhypen and fan service,"Sharing this here because this confused me. I do get OP. I do. In the sense that when I'm not into a group, I will have a different impression of them than what they actually are, as their own fans know them. 

When I wasn't into Enhypen (which was until December 2024 lol), I actually didn't pay any attention to them so I had zero knowledge about anyone. I saw them in Game Caterers but I watched it for Seventeen so they were just kinda there. 

When I first got into Enhypen, it felt like they were really leaning towards the ""vampire boyfriend"" concept. But since I'm not the target audience, I didn't receive them as vampire boyfriends lol. The impression also quickly faded away as I got to know the group. 

Non-fans will always have something to say about their dynamics and how they treat their fans. They're not ""gay enough"" for some. They're too ""boring"" for some. Etc etc.

You can somehow feel when it's fan service. All idols do it. It's hard to survive in their industry if they don't do it. But I'm curious... as a fan, what are the moments with Enhypen that made you feel like they're not just doing it for the fan service? Like they're being genuine?

For me, to name a few, it's Jungwon's almost perfect attendance on Weverse. Trust me, it's hard to be consistent in anything, more so if you're tired or busy. That takes dedication. And I believe he's been doing it since debut (correct me if I'm wrong). 

Also in their recent WTL in Bulacan. Where they went all out with the production and their message to Filipino engenes. I felt their connection with their Filipino fans, even if it was only my first few months being their fan. I also feel the sincerity in Jay's message in interviews and lives. Jake's ment in WTL Bulacan also felt sincere, where he said he wishes for fans to always be happy. 

Fan service is part of their jobs as idols, but if their hearts are not in it, it'll show. It always shows. And so far, that doesn't seem to be the case with them. Aside from their occasional, obligatory vampire boyfriend persona, I don't think it got to a point where they're deceiving their fans or deluding their fans? Or maybe I'm just not that impressionable?

Thoughts?

Enhypenthoughts,1jijven,2025-03-24 06:50:25,En-drama enthusiasts,"I just finished rewatching the series thru a reaction channel (New Chapter Reactions) and I still feel the same way. I like this drama. It may be full of cliches and the acting may not be the best they have to offer, but it's so heartwarming that I found myself smiling all throughout and tearing up at the end.

I am a fan of full circle moments, so that was a huge thing for me when I first saw it. How it was like a relay of stories and then coming back to Jungwon with Ni-ki coming up to the rooftop. I like how it portrays their real life traits or at least how they are perceived. There is some grain of truth in each episode.

How Jungwon feels the pressure of being a leader. How people make assumptions about Heeseung. I think these two got me the most because of how well the two acted and also how close to home their roles were. 

Jay's role, I feel, was mostly derived from his appearance. He has that bad boy look. And plus, he likes to sleep haha. 

Jake's word vomit is cute, esp those little Ikeu's that appeared on his side haha. His role was the type to take a step back. Sunghoon's role touched me as someone who doesn't open up to people easily. Being judged for looking cold and unapproachable. 

Sunoo is liked by everyone in this universe because he is very personable, but there was also the need to please the people around him to keep being liked. And Niki, what I got from his story is that he is someone who gets flustered when presented with something new (this time a new feeling). But tbh, I wish they did more with Ni-ki's character. Maybe a back story. Something for people to resonate with. 

Their message to Eunjin (Engenes) in the end made me tear up. 

Engenes who like them for who they are.

Engenes who always listen to them.

Engenes who always look out for them.

Engenes who even like their clumsy side.

Engenes who opened up their hearts.

Engenes whom they love the most.

Engenes, their one and only.

I know this is may be just a silly little web series to some, but it has so much potential and I wish they would do another web drama that is more fleshed out and has a better storyline. And with an actual female lead. I want to see them act with a real person. The POV is not doing it for me. I'm done with first person's POV a long time ago haha. But it doesn't have to be a love story. It can just be a youth drama or a friendship drama. Idk. Maybe this is just wishful thinking, seeing how busy they are. But at least we got en-drama. The story is simple and cute, yet it tugs at your heart strings somehow. ",27,5

individually, mr heeseung we are STILL waiting for a cover of die for you by the weeknd. anythiinnnng rbnb w him. 

idk abt any songs jay should do in specific, but maybe epic guitar stuff. he tends to take high notes full on, so yeah.

as for jake, a calmer song for sure. i dont think i’m okay was the perfect cover for him. maybe butterfly by bts.

for sunghoon, a slick sultry song would fit him like a glove. idk any songs in particular, but bring on the obnoxious (violin?) strings and the cautious beat.

jungwon. we saw u in blossom lil bro. monster too. epic ballads would suit him well. idk any songs in particular tbh.

for sunoo, i think he’d suit a flirty and playful concept, with a hint of….mystery. like sir we saw you in the smoky eye makeup don’t lie to me.  i think many of taemin’s songs would agree with that. move, deja vu, crush, there’s a lot. taemin does falsetto a lot and sunoo seems to enjoy doing it too. or another bibi song COUGH COUGH MOTOSPEED 24 COUGHHH. i get the feel that he wants to do more non-cute concepts

ni-ki i think would do a hip hop song type thing. or a song that has dance allowing the fluidity he includes so much of. options are open, he‘s pretty versatile. idk fs abt him.",27,23

Enhypenthoughts,1jg7qu6,2025-03-21 04:32:20,"It’s Not Cute, It’s Embarrassing—Have Some Shame Enhypen are not sex symbols","Every day, some Engenes get bolder in sexualizing the members, and it’s honestly disgusting. I recently saw an Instagram post ranking how “freaky” someone is based on their bias. Heeseung was at the top with a caption saying, “I understand, just look at the way he looks at us—he’s basically begging Engenes to s#ck him.” That post had thousands of likes—maybe even over 10k. And the worst part? Some of my own moots liked it.

Let’s be real—if Enhypen were women and Engenes were men, this would be an issue. It would be called out instantly, no hesitation. But just because they’re men, suddenly it’s “funzies” or “not that deep”? No. Double standards aside, this is blatant disrespect. Even Jungwon has acknowledged the way some fans behave and isn’t afraid to call it out. THATS EMBARRASSING. That alone should tell you how out of hand this is.

And let’s talk about these so-called “freaky” edits. Some of them use clips from when the members were minors. Do you hear yourselves? Do you not see how incredibly disturbing that is? There is a very real difference between normal attraction and constantly reducing someone to a sexual object. They are real people, not characters in a fantasy.

If your reaction to this is, “I’m no better than a man,” then congratulations—you aren’t. You are literally participating in the same objectification and entitlement that women have been fighting against for decades. The only difference is that now, it’s men on the receiving end, and somehow that makes it okay? No. It’s still disgusting.

As a Christian, I personally believe lust is a sin, but even putting religion aside—how can you look at someone who has worked their whole life to be where they are and reduce them to nothing but a fantasy? That’s not admiration. That’s not love. That’s objectification. If you really respect them, then act like it.

Enhypenthoughts,1jf5qex,2025-03-19 20:40:20,Have you ever liked an ENHYPEN song for a randomly weird moment?,"Recently, I came to like one of the rare songs of ENHYPEN’s main discography that had not gelled well with me previously. And the reason why I checked out the song again was very weird. I had never liked Future Perfect(Pass the Mic). It was the only ENHYPEN title track that I had not liked. But recently, I came across this compilation of funny ENHYPEN moments. I saw that clip of Sunghoon aggressively singing Future Perfect during a gym session(you know, the “You stay still! You stay! You stay!” line). That line just got stuck in my head and started popping at the most random moments, and I found myself bopping to it. Then, I saw the dance practice video in which Sunghoon was carrying out a not-so-secret mission of touching the floor gazillion times. And I ended up liking the song while listening to it,there.I really like the pre-chorus and the Pass the Mic lines. And, now I listen to it often. Looking back at it, it was such a random moment that had brought me back to the song and well, made me appreciate Jake, Heeseung and Sunoo’s lines in the song!

Have you ever had such a moment where you ended up liking an ENHYPEN song for a really strange but good reason? I guess I wanted to share this moment of my suddenly liking Future Perfect after not liking it for the past 3 years.

i'm actually appalled by this decision because this is easily one of their BEST performance videos. the styling is literally perfect (no such thing as too much of enha looking like fine gentlemen in suits + a few more crumbs of jake with long blonde hair during dark blood era). the set is so dark and gorgeous and doesn't just fit but substantially enhances the mood of the song, along with the fast and rough camerawork and the flashy lighting. the mixing is SO GOOD too. somehow their vocals sounds more melodious, and the background vocals are a bit louder as well. this is probably going to be my most-watched video by the end of the year.",35,2

I admit that it can be worrying that Jungwon mentioned he's happy about losing more weight and that he's asking if a watermelon has calories. We shouldn't assume he's in a bad state but it does raise an eyebrow if he's okay given how the industry works.


But what I don’t like is the way Engenes are reacting to it. If you look at X or TikTok, as usual, the first reaction is to blame Belift.

""Belift is forcing them to diet"" ""Belift isn’t making them eat well"" ""Belift is restricting and controlling them"" ""Belift is forcing them to show muscles for Coachella"" blah blah blah. That’s always Engenes’ first reaction all the fucking time—blame Belift.


Did we just collectively forget that **AI edits of Enhypen were trending for the past few days?** Those edits were even posted on Weverse, to the point that Jay saw an AI edit of himself and commented on it. 


Before we start pointing fingers at someone else, how about we look at our own behavior first? We can’t make AI edits and then say it’s just for fun or it’s not that serious. Because it *is* harmful, they *do see it*, and it does *affect their mental health.*


Of course, companies are known for encouraging diets as part of the industry and it’s something we can call out. But this time, maybe we should point the fingers at ourselves first—because we made those AI edits viral, not Belift.


I’m just so tired of some Engenes doing something problematic then blaming the company to wash their hands of accountability. Some Engenes even show up to airports then wonder why can't Belift stop the mobbing? Start shipping wars then wonder why the members are awkward? Make AI edits of their bodies then wonder why they're going on extreme diets?



I hope they stop seeing those AI edits already. I just hope Jungwon and the others are happy and healthy. And I hope Engenes stop blaming the company as a reaction and start looking at their own behavior first before they point fingers.

He’s been my bias since border:carnival era and he has changed so much since then. From what I’ve noticed, he’s definitely a cool guy, both in demeanour and style, and it’s clear he loves to play into the ‘fake emo’ persona that he has, but I honestly think he has a lot more layers than people give him credit for. 

He is clearly extremely driven and dedicated, and this is evident in how much his vocals have improved over the years (obviously his dancing is always on point too), he’s clearly focused on giving Engenes an amazing show at every performance. Also, his recent interactions with kiddie-Engenes have made me smile. I think he’s been trying to show a warmer, chalant (for lack of a better word) side of himself.

Does anyone have any observations for how he is? Particularly beneath his bad-boy exterior, which obviously I love too.

Also, this is based more on inklings than concrete evidence so don’t come for me, but I feel like Niki’s mood can fluctuate quite a lot. I presume it’s because of fatigue and stress, but I do think he goes through periods of seeming like he has more energy or ‘social battery’ and at other times.

1. Heeseung!! Idk why he just looks so captivating when he performs. Like he stares into the camera and you will instantly melt. He is so good with connecting with his audience!

2. Jay looks sooo pretty in that hairstyle ugh. I can't get over it. Although, he doesn't have a lot of lines on this one, does he?

3. Many fans are saying that Chaconne is Sunghoon's song and I agree (But also Heesueng?!!)

4. There is one part where Sunoo was in the center and he moved backwards and sat and I tried to do that and I thought I would fall on my back. How do they do that?? It's like their bodies are so light and they don't lose their balance when their movements involve the floor. I was really amazed how effortless that move was, I had to watch it again.

5. Jake's part wasn't as memorable in this one. Idk if he has a killing part in this song? Still, he delivered but I have not much to say about his part other than he executed it well. I wanna see him have a moment like he did in Fatal Trouble. Any recos for songs that he has stand out parts?

6. Ni-ki looked so effortless cool. But I feel like I didn't hear him sing because I was so focused on how he danced haha

7. It was funny that I keep noticing Jungwon's pants. It looks like it was the extension of his top, creating an optical illusion. The way he pops his body is so satisfying to watch. The body control is always amazing.

  
Anyway, I just dropped by to share these here. ",31,4
Enhypenthoughts,1jbnop1,2025-03-15 05:59:46,i would love to see enhypen cover another bts song,"like either as ot7 or in units. like as a whole group they can do black swan, love maze, life goes on, dna, the possibilities are endless.

 units wise, maybe for example heeseung sunoo jungwon ni-ki can do truth untold or house of cards and jake sunghoon and jay can do home. 

In terms of solos, i feel like ni-ki suit V's songs, like singularity. 

heeseung or sunoo could do still w you by jk like i NEED that shit. 

sunoo would eat up jimin's songs. he would probably suit serendipity. 

for jay i think he would do well with one of rm's ballads COUGH COUGH forever rain.

for jungwon i think he'd do well with one of jhope's sung songs, like just dance.

for sunghoon he probably would slay jin's songs, like i can see him singing epiphany for some reason. 

for jake i think he'd do well with some of suga's softer songs like seesaw. 

  
most of this will probably never in a gazillion years happen but oh well. we can dream. random ass thought

It's really friendly, chill, and we match each other's freaks when it comes to fangirling/fanboying over new content. If the OP is thoughtful, the answers are also thoughtful. If the OP is tweaking out, the comments are tweaking out too 😂


People give insightful answers and the discussion is always respectful. There are a lot of interesting questions and I think Engenes are really cool, including the ones I met in real life.


I've noticed as well that Engenes are really welcoming to baby Engenes. Engenes always answers their questions on this sub even if it's been asked before and I think it's really sweet. This made me want to do the same and welcome baby Engenes warmly too. 


I also like that we don't ""cancel"" baby Engenes for their fresh opinions on the group (especially since there used to be a lot of rumors about Enha during their debut) and instead try to correct them. 


I've been a multi before and this is probably the warmest fandom (and kpop sub) I've experienced. Other fandoms are sort of, a little more intense and strict? Their intensity about the group makes it depressing sometimes. I guess the atmosphere here is more relaxed because we're a mix of Engenes and casuals. We even upvote cute things to appreciate them even if we don't say anything—that's such an Enhypen thing to do lol


I think we mirror Enhypen a lot. They may be a chill and quiet group of guys but they're really fun to talk to and that's what I feel about Engenes too.

Enhypenthoughts,1ja2x22,2025-03-13 04:26:58,"Jake, Jungwon, Sunghoon, and Ni-ki's vocal appreciation","I don't see a lot of it so I want to hear from other engenes.

The three not mentioned in the title are great vocalists and always get mentioned when we talk about vocals.

Heeseung adds his own flavor to the songs and carries the ad-libs. He is also a vocal chameleon.

Jay has a very distinct and pretty vocal tone and is also great at extending notes (esp high notes).

Sunoo has stable vocals and wide range, from really low register to high notes.

  
BUT\~

I also want to highlight the other members. 

I feel like Jake has a lot of good parts (he has a lot of parts in songs) and it always makes me wonder why he doesn't get mentioned as much as the other three. Jake also has a good range, stable vocals, and pretty vocal tone. I feel like he's one of the most reliable members in terms of vocals. Maybe it doesn't sound as trendy as Heeseung's voice or as distinct as Jay's or Jungwon's voice so it tends to be overlooked sometimes?

Sunghoon, while he rarely gets more than a few lines in songs, always delivers. I feel like his voice is not the most versatile in terms of vibe (?). Like he fits some songs more than the others. But having said that, he excels in falsettos and breathy parts because his voice has this airy and haunting quality to it. Does he have a solo cover or song yet? I want to hear more of his voice.

Jungwon (my bias), like Sunghoon, has a voice that fits some songs better than the other songs. One example of this is Future Perfect. While he still has a lot to improve on, his voice already has a unique tone and when he gets to sing the perfect song for it, I think it's going to be really magical. I especially loved the bridge to the last chorus (if I remembercorrectly) of his cover song. 

Ni-ki, while I love him for being an excellent dancer, needs to be praised for his vocals as well. He keeps the songs grounded with his low voice. He gives their songs depth and richness, but his high voice is really something as well. I can't remember where he does the falsetto, tho (Guilty by Taemin stage?). Not sure if he's not as confident with the high notes as he is with the lower notes, but I really love hearing his lower notes. It sometimes sounds like it's caressing the back of the ears. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't he do the ad libs (low notes) as well?",73,24

*""That's why I think the most important thing is to try something first. I think the most important thing is to enjoy your one and only life without regrets.""*

*""I don't think you really need to worry about what other people think. If you have the confidence that you can make a decision and follow through, shouldn't you do it?""*

*""I want to be real, honest, and not fake, so I try to live life to the fullest so that I don't regret it later. I can't change the past, but I can change the future with my actions.""*

*""to take on challenges without fear and with the mindset of ""Fight and overcome"". If you do that, you will not regret anything, with the thought that it is more important to take on at least one challenge than to do nothing, I think you will move in the right direction.""* This is Ni-ki's position, which he expressed in various interviews.

Go for your dream, it is better to be disappointed that you did not achieve your dream even after doing everything you can, than not to try and regret it. Your life is your life, you must make your own choices. Dare, go ahead, no matter how old you are, but there is always time to try to do something you dreamed of.",33,2

I know Belift is trying to handle it, but at this point, I wouldn’t be shocked if they decide to stop doing lives altogether which would be really upsetting since they have consistently been doing lives since debut. 

Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Sunoo, and now Sunghoon have called them out. Won’t be surprised if Jake and Ni-ki call them out soon too.

The problem with Saesangs though is that they don’t care if they get a good or bad reaction, they just want them to react to them, which is why I fear it won't stop anytime soon.

for songs that they exclusively perform on tours only (lucifer, teeth) they did use studio mixes but for songs that they always perform on shows and such/title tracks they use remixes so its really really enjoyable to hear

this somehow gives an exclusivity bc u only get to hear it once you go to their concert which i think is so thoughtful and a nice way of making sure their concert is worth it

for sunghoon i'm thinking he sticks to the vampire concept but amps it UP. like a sultry slithery type. kind like imma be by xlov. and yes, lots of violin

for jungwon i'm thinking acoustic guitar type songs like blue and grey by bts or maze in the mirror by txt, and farewell neverland also by txt.

for jay definetely some nice electric guitars to some soulful but lively songs, like love me or leave me by day6. or not mine, also by them.

for jake, i'm thinking full on piano ballads straight out a kdrama. like lia from itzys osts. or rewrite the stars

for ni-ki i think he suits a full on dark/horror concept the best. i can totally see him with a lot of fake blood lol. something like scream by dreamcatcher or venom by skz. he could sing low the entire time and the chorus would be an epic and maybe scary dance break instrumental.

Enhypenthoughts,1j3y783,2025-03-05 09:03:37,"""Does Enhypen Suffer from Men Illness, or Are Haters the Ones with Mental Illness?""","Warning: I'm gonna rant to my heart content

Can we just talk about the absolute madness surrounding Enhypen lately? These boys are drowning in a tidal wave of hate for the most ridiculous, petty reasons imaginable, and I’m beyond fed up—especially with the outrage over Sunghoon spitting his gum into a tissue during a concert. Yes, you heard that right: SPITTING GUM INTO A TISSUE. This is what’s setting the internet ablaze, folks. Sunghoon, our ice prince, our flawless visual, casually doing something *hygienic,* wrapping his gum in a tissue like a civilized human being and then tossing it aside mid-performance, and suddenly he’s public enemy number one? Are you kidding me? People are acting like he committed a war crime instead of, I don’t know, keeping the stage clean while delivering vocals, choreography, and charisma that most of us could only dream of pulling off.

Let’s break this down: It was a concert, Walk the line in Bulacan, for those who’ve been living under a rock, where Enhypen was pouring their hearts out, sweating buckets, and giving fans a show to remember. Sunghoon, during soundcheck, had the audacity to chew gum (oh, the horror!) and then, instead of spitting it on the floor like some barbarian, he grabbed a tissue, spit it out, and chucked it into a corner. A CORNER. Not at a fan, not into someone’s drink, not even dramatically across the stage—he just discreetly got rid of it so he could keep slaying the setlist. And yet, the keyboard warriors lost their minds. “Disrespectful!” they screamed. “Gross!” they cried. “Unhygienic!”, as if he didn’t literally use a tissue to avoid making a mess. Meanwhile, these same haters are probably typing their venomous comments with unwashed hands after scrolling in public bathrooms (will they accept if I talk like this) The hypocrisy is deafening.

This isn’t just about Enhypen, though—oh no, this is a full-blown epidemic in the K-pop world. Idols are getting shredded left and right for breathing too loudly, blinking too much, or—gasp—being “too straight,” as if that’s a crime now. Sunghoon and the boys can’t catch a break. They’re out here working their souls to the bone, dropping bangers like “no doubt” and “XO,” and yet the second they show a shred of humanity, like, say, disposing of gum in a tissue, they’re crucified. Meanwhile, when they do something amazing, like donating to charity or hyping up their fans with pure love, it barely gets a whisper. But Sunghoon’s gum? Oh, that’s trending for days. DAYS. Over a tissue. Let that sink in.

And don’t get me started on where this hate’s coming from. I’m not in China or Korea, so I can’t say for sure, but the sheer volume of venom spewing from those corners of the internet is impossible to ignore. Is it a trend now? Pick a random idol who’s shining too bright and tear them to pieces? Because that’s what it feels like. These hateful comments often lost in translation but dripping with malice, aren’t just petty; they’re weapons. They chip away at these artists’ confidence, their mental health, their will to keep going. Imagine being Sunghoon, on stage, giving your all, only to find out later that thousands of people are calling you “disgusting” over a gum tissue moment. It’s not just unfair—it’s cruel.

Here’s the kicker: there are actual scumbags out there—people doing vile, unforgivable things—and yet the internet’s collective energy is laser-focused on Sunghoon’s gum tissue toss or Enhypen being “too straight” (whatever that even means). We’re not talking about idols who’ve done genuinely awful stuff—those exist, and I’m not defending them. But this? This is innocent. This is a guy spitting gum into a tissue and still managing to look like a Greek god while doing it. If that’s the hill haters want to die on, they need to rethink their priorities.

So, can we please, just for once, let Sunghoon and Enhypen breathe? Can we stop blowing up every tiny, human moment into a scandal and start calling out the real trash in this world? Because I’m tired of seeing these boys, who live for their art and their fans, get dragged through the mud over a tissue while the real villains walk free. Sunghoon deserves better. Enhypen deserves better. And frankly, we all deserve better than this senseless hate circus.

personally i believe that there might be a chance that another stop might be added for the summer edition but at the same time i'm not that onboard with the idea considering how packed they are for the rest of the year. i was thinking maybe they'll add a stop but in 2026 but idk

as a filo engene, maybe just maybe we'll have a stop here as well for it cuz of the amount of "" see you soon"" we got from them ??? 😮‍💨😮‍💨 cuz i was thinking as well that the waterguns was a spoiler of some sort ykyk

Enhypenthoughts,1j37wb7,2025-03-04 11:33:34,I-Land for New/Baby Engenes!!,"I've noticed alot of baby and new Engenes\^\^ I'm really glad we're growing as a fandom. And I've been in your shoes before so I know the pain and immense search it takes surfing the net and Reddit for places to watch I-Land:((

I was a fan when I-Land first aired during covid times and did live voting for the members. Back then I stopped watching the show until Episode 10 because as a highschooler I couldn't bear the anxiety of the live eliminations each week. After years later, through a series of events I eventually folded and became an official Engene last year during XO Era and my first comeback with Enha was DayDream & No Doubt!! When I became an Engene I decided to rewatch all of I-Land until the very last episode without the anxiety of the final lineup (all 7 members now).

The day I decided to buy I-Land on Weverse (a few months ago, somewhere fall/winter 2024) BeLift or whoever dafaqu managing Enha's Weverse took it down (bc I guess their relation with Mnet is weird now or smthing? Idkk) and I got the notification of NEVER selling the official (original & best quality) I-Land all episodes. I got the notification at school and was really sad for a moment because although I'm grateful for OG Engenes who uploaded all eps on YTube, I got to a point where I HATED the low quality. Like they don't do the members' visuals justice.



BUT GOOD NEWS!!

I was watching a new kdrama (Friendly Rivalry- a GL starring Hyeri, I got interested ever since HeeSunJay's interview at her show, Hyell's Club). And on the website I was watching I stumbled across I-Land 1 and 2 on there.

This is by far, THE BEST QUALITY I've seen WITH SUBS of ALL 12 Episodes of I-land. It ain't no 4K like premium stuff, but in my eyes they're DEFINITELY 1080. I have a ad-blocker on my laptop and the quality, the subs, everything was the best from this source, that I've watched by far. I JUST HAVE TO SHARE.

In another thread there was an Engene who didn't know what Chamber 5 was. It made me think, there must be so many interested fans and Engenes who watch I-Land through the not-so-great quality on YTube or thru clips on TTok (I know I did). So for New/Baby Engenes (and current Engenes who want good quality & FREE I-Land) THIS IS MY GIFT TO YOU\^\^

Enhypenthoughts,1j2lrib,2025-03-03 16:52:39,stanning enhypen is always so worth it - walk the line bulacan concert realizations,"i have been a fan since 2020, i was there when the first iland episode aired and i very much rooted for all enhypen members back then especially jungwon. its been almost 5 years since i became a fan and out of all my fangirl phases, i felt like this was my most successful one which makes them so so worth it.

enhypen is fairly on the popular side, especially internationally. given that, you'd think it's hard to get their attention or get noticed - what most fans desire the most. with enhypen? it was so easy for me to get them. mostly it's because they pay really good attention to engenes and they are really sincere with treating them well. jungwon is especially good at it, being the most active at weverse and interacting with as many fans as he could even until now, almost 5 years after their debut. with that being said, i'm obviously one of the many people that have had interactions with him on weverse and with other artists i stanned, that was so hard to achieve. and it's not just me, with a fandom so big, most engene i'm close with have interacted with jungwon as well which somehow shows how much time he spends to interact with fans. not only jungwon but i've also had weverse interactions with other members.

now onto the concert part. i have always loved their discography and obviously i would be getting the best seats on the show as much as i can and all i can say is all that money i spent to see them live was worth it. first of all, if not all, almost everything is live. moreover, they are insane performers on stage so you would really enjoy the show. i've seen enhypen in all their tours and each of them was something that i really enjoyed compared to other artists. the production this time was grand too, with all the fireworks and stage set up. one thing about enhypen is that they will always maximize the entire stage \[even the entire venue\] no matter how big or small it is.  as a fan, it is really a touching act that shows their sincereness and gratefulness for all the fans that attended their shows. in all shows i attended, they have always tried going around the venue to make sure no fan is left out of the enhypen experience. they really show their appreciation to each fan.

2022 manifesto in manila - after the encore, they had a surprise encore going near the fans and extending the concert the time. i had the opportunity to see them upclose despite being far from the stage. the organizer also said that enhypen themselves personally requested to give out unlimited water for people in the pit so engenes wouldn't faint.

2023 - fate in seoul - they went around in carts and even walked around the nosebleed seats to be able to interact at the fans at the back

2025 - wtl in bulacan - the stage was absolutely HUGE. there were 3 stages in the stadium and they were able to maximize them all. all floor tiers were worth it because most likely everyone saw them really close. moreover, they went around the entire venue with carts so even people seating on bleachers in the furthest back had the opportunity to see them upclose.

an especially sweet memory from two days ago was seeing jungwon during soundcheck run to the very edge of the extended stage to wave at the lone engene with mobility issues in the bleachers. ni-ki spotting a kid and giving her special attention was so touching too.

all i've talked about is basically how they interact with fans but i just wanna talk about it here because not all artists are like this. i love it so much that enhypen has been really appreciative of their fans and this is definitely a quality that will make them grow bigger.

this was just a really long think piece about how i am grateful for enhypen always working hard and being appreciative of engenes so my thoughts are all over the place.",82,3

And although there is certainly a moment in the fact that Ni-ki himself was a little fan, that's why he is so happy with little fans now that he himself has become an artist. But the key point is that he simply loves children. With what tenderness he looked at a crying child in a cafe in Poland, babysat a baby at the airport in Japan and I believe that he would take baby Saanvi with him from the show in his pocket if he was allowed)))

Once at the enoclock he mentioned that he would do everything he can for his children. And I understand that he will give them first of all a lot of love.",92,17

Enhypenthoughts,1j1fd3i,2025-03-02 02:29:58,Enhypen: Then and Now,"To preface, I watched them since iland to debut to every concert and fanmeet they held in my country (Philippines). I remember seeing them live for the second time it was for Manifesto concert. I remember thinking their performances are okay which I thought is normal because they are new to the concert scene. I love their songs so I continued being an engene. Then Fate concert came, I thought to myself I loved Fate so much more than Manifesto. It was because their performances are much better, they were better artists. 

I am writing this after their Walk the Line concert here in the Philippines. One word insane. They radiated so much confidence. They commanded the stage even the carts lol. They commanded the stage so well that for the first time, I repeatedly kept on forgetting to film their stages because I was too focused on their performances. No one is lacking. I forgot what performance it was that I became teary eyed because suddenly Manifesto perfomances came back in mind and I thought how far they have become as artists. I love how they keep on pushing themselves to be better artists than they were yesterday. Their growth as artists are immensely evident. 

On another note, there was a segment on the concert where engenes flashed their posters. There were so many congratulating them on their daesang win. Enhypen are thirsty for more, they wouldn't bother improving if they weren't. We just need to support them with all our might. ",202,12

Kpop stans seriously needs to leave an idols love life and sexuality. I know a large number of people in this community are yaoi lovers(even I read yaoi webtoons) and people often jokes about an idol being definitely gay. From what I have seen if a male idol acts cute, likes pink, takes care of their look, is sassy or a bit savage, they are easily called out gay. Like I know you support lgbtq community and is fond about it but that doesn't give you the permission to assume someone's sexuality. And you know if the male idols in a group are not being touchy or gay enough, they become boring. The proof is the recent case with Enhypen. And some people are defending them by saying ""They are straightest group I've ever seen, they can never be gay. They love hot women"". I actually got into a fight with a fan who literally made a whole story about Enhypen. So according to her logic, Enhypen are old fashioned Christians who are based in Sk obviously with Sunoo and Sunghoon being the pure Christian. And Sunoo maintains the group properly and maintains discipline because he is pure Christian and that Every member has crush on him and that is the reason they are straight. She also said, they will definitely marry women in future or else the world will seem to end. She loves them because they are straight. And then one fan coming with the comment, ""But what about Sunoo, he is straight?"". I was so mad honestly because first of all ok you are defending them nice nut what's with the ""They are the straightest group ever. They treat women nicely"" Oh yeah a gay man treats women like shit probably according to your logic. Like I hate this kind of stereotypes, ""You are straight if you act cold and dominant but you a gay for acting sassy and for not liking sports"". FYI I have a teacher who have no interests in sport or whatsoever but is still married with a women and has a baby. I don't think the typical logic of being gay or straight applies to him. And secondly, people still thinks Sunoo is gay. Like who tf are you to assume his sexuality? Can people leave this thing please? Can't you guys live for even a day without making stories and fake scenarios about them? Like they are not some fictional characters, they are real life humans who can actually see this comments.",56,38

Something I wanna see/expect are new sides of Enhypen that we haven't seen before. Coachella isn't just a regular concert. The audience aren't all going to Engenes. I hope the locals can praise (and hopefully not criticize) our Enha. Like I really wish Enhypen brings something HISTORICAL this Enchella. Like Black Pink Coachella level ICONIC. Iknow Les Serrafim & ATEEZ came last year but I secretly and sincerely wish ENHYPEN to leave a permanent, influential, and SERVE the best set yet. I want our sevEN to live up and surpass their ""Future of Kpop"" title. No hate to other groups! I know they won't be like BTS level overnight (coming from a ""retired"" ARMY from 2015-2020) but I still wish Enha could leave an impressive presence in the Western music world since they are GLOBAL artists. 

  
A few songs I really want on there is DayDream, Paranormal, Given-Taken, BLESSED-CURSED and sm more!!

I also strongly think that Jake will get lots of appreciation because of his Aussie accent, fluent English, and foreign charms that I think suits american/western audience rlly well.   
Iknow that Heeseung, Jay, and Ni-Ki would want to go all out and they will definiely have their moments. I'm guessing Ni-Ki would have a solo dance break, or dbreaks as a unit. Jay would get a guitar solo, and Heeseung is going to make big gestures, sing perfectly, and crowd control brillantly.  

One reddit post said Jungwon might become the new Chaewon (from Lssrfm's last coachella appearance), and I lowkey agree. Especially with his blonde right now, he'll definitely shine (I'm a little biased)\^\^

 

But I'm curious to see Sunghoon and Sunoo this Enchella!! Iknow Sunghoon would definitely get recognized for his visuals but I hope he can show a different side of his concert self this time. Maybe something lowkey unexpected? 

Same with Sunoo! He's always smiling, emotional, sweet, BUT if he were to debut a new look, a different sort of energy- maybe their stylist team will listen and he'll have that lip piercing, eybrow slit, or different hair? I want to be like pleasantly surprised. I also think if Sunoo sang a bridge, or had like a surprise moment, like imagine Sunoo rapping 2 verses?!! Wouldn't that be legendary and iconic?? 

  
I'm predicting they will perform, or spoil a little something from their next comeback coming right after Coachella. But what if there was another surprise? OKAY HEAR ME OUT-- Yknow how our Enha won a Daesang recently at D-Awards? Idk how many Engenes are new or at experienced the heartbreak/immense efforts we Engenes made for fucking MAMA last year, but anyways-- during a live, the members promised us something. Okay- imagine this : 

CHAMBER 5 at Enchella. 

Not only would I be sobbing and leaping in pure joy, wouldn't it be insane if they performed Chamber 5 more fitting for the festival and made a rock or lowkey metal version of Chamber 5?!! Or even if it's not a complete genre change, I think if anything Chamber 5 was performed again, I will literally be so happy. The last time they ever performed Chamber 5 was YEARS ago:(( But even if they don't perform Chmbr 5 ever again, I still hope they record& release a studio single of it. Or maybe it can be the next Highway 1009 and they could sneak it into the end of their new album? IDKK I just really love Chamber 5\~\~

  
Anyways uhm, if you read all of this, thank you smm. This was my lil late night thoughts, but I also wanna know if I'm not the only Engene with wishful expectations like these??

I've seen a quote retweet from an actual queer person who said that they like enhypen because they don't do gay for pay, so they don't portray the stereotypical queer/gay people and I guess that makes people outside of the stereotypes feel seen and I absolutely love that.

I'm straight and someone's sexuality doesn't usually affect how I see them or how I like them. But I would love to hear more from the queer/gay fans. 

I've seen older groups do fan service for the gay community and they do too much sometimes. And I've seen actual, genuine relationships/friendships between members get ruined because of too much shipping. 

I'm not the kind of fan who imagines herself as her idol's girlfriend of their anything, tbh so I don't mind if an idol is gay or straight beause they should be loved, first and foremost, for their artistry.",76,70

A fan made an edit of heeseung dancing to bills and it went extremely viral, people tagging their version of the dance challenge with ""Li Xicheng March"" ""Li Xicheng Parade"" ""Li Xicheng got his own parade"" and so forth.

If you consume Chinese media, you'll know how rare it is for a kpop idol to trend amongst huge names like these (see pic).

Heeseung also recreated this viral challenge on both tiktok and douyin after a Chinese fan told him he went viral during the recent fansign.

Enhypenthoughts,1iz4h1z,2025-02-27 02:47:28,about hyeri and heeseung shipping,"so i loved watching hyells club and ive always loved hyeri - variety sense, acting, humour etc. and shes an amazing host with lots of natural chemistry with whoever the guests are! 

recently though ive been seeing ppl post about heeseung and hyeri flirting. id like to say first of all, i love seeing female and male idols interact comfortably in any setting, show or not. and yes they were definitely very comfortable with each other during the show and that makes me really happy to watch that they could be real people amongst each other. my issue with claiming they were “flirting” is that more often than not, the female idol takes the brunt of the shipping, gets hate from the male idols fans and even her own. yes, they arent dating and i dont care if they do in the end cos good for them — but the issue is that engenes can be a pretty delusional bunch (ref, jungwon winter rumour in december 2024…) and yea sure engenes are also the ones posting about hee and hyeris chemistry, but when ppl lowkey express their discomfort with the shipping, they just go oh its for fun! 

yes, but at the same time you’re analysing every small detail and it comes across as not really? i think people dont fully get that this could just cause misunderstandings for delusional fans who take that to heart and attack hyeri. again, ill reiterate that im all for female male idols interactions!! i just dont think its necessary to turn every interaction into a shipping opportunity lest that remove the comfortability in them interacting in the first place. 

ngl, if it were another male idol group, i dont think id have the same reaction of fear for hyeri. engenes have shown how insanely possessive they can be about the boys so… idk im pretty cynical about this whole thing…

just my thoughts and opinions on some recent posts that ive seen :) feel free to discuss !! ",32,29

Enhypenthoughts,1iyizhm,2025-02-26 09:33:38,"ENHYPEN'S JINJJA GOT MEMBERS WITH THE FINEST, MOST UNIQUE VOCALS AND LET'S TALK ABOUT IT","hiiii engenes<33

I started getting into enha around october last year, so I've been with them for 5 months now and I can't stress enough on how much their music feeds my soul. Their first ever song I heard was Drunk-Dazed, around the covid quarantine when it was blowing up everywhere, and the song that pushed me off the cliff, so to speak, was fatal trouble. I'm afraid if I'm going to be derailed if I start talking about fatal trouble cause it's genuinely a piece of art, incomparable and exquisite.

Anyway back to what the title says, I've noticed how distinct everyone's vocals are in the best way possible; and not in your generic kpop boy group way either. What's even better is that despite the discrepancies in their vocal tones, they all complement each other so exceptionally well that I fear I can't ever encapsulate the effect of, in words.

So consider this somewhat of a rant cause I need to talk about this or I'll explode.

* Heeseung: Heeseung has, imo, got a very versatile tone and anyone who disagrees has clearly not listened to him sing. He has this range of emotions that he can deliver in a single verse and I think that's what makes him so flexible to suit each concept. Take Criminal Love, for example, his chorus is filled with the raw energy of unabashedness, every note sung wantonly, a stark contrast to Highway 1009, which lies more on the softer side, the intimacy of every note undeniable. Even in Fatal Trouble, all his choruses are so unretsrained, you can *feel* him feel every lyric to the very core of his bones and the best part is, well this maybe just me but I can hear his voice transition with every chorus from anger to disorientation to pleading. Whoever said he sings like he's been through 40 divorces couldn't've put it better. His singing is like the pied piper's tune, you can't help but want to keep listening to it and drown in it.
* Jay: Jay's vocal range is truly something else. His voice has this natural tinge of yearning to it, which is why everytime he's given the extended high notes or choruses in songs that have an undercurrent of longing, he devours it completely. Brought The Heat Back's bridge showed his tone in all it's glory with that high note of his. Using Fatal Trouble as an exhibit again, Jay's vocals in the second chorus complement Heeseung's first chorus so handsomely. While Heeseung's singing with this energy of underlying anger, at whoever the song is directed to and at himself, Jay's chorus is the opposite of it in that you can hear the agony in his voice, the stretch of note to the point that makes you realise if he  holds it for a second longer, he's going to cry and it's genuinely so beautiful to me. Apart from his yearner's tone, he has a voice that knows where to hold the note for a tad longer, or break it off a tad short, maybe not even noticeable except in the effect it makes, Lucifer I'd say, displays this very nicely.
* Jake: I don't see enough appreciation for his voice and it pmo so bad because his voice is truly so precious. I've noticed his voice has this slight rasp to it and it honest to god makes me want to EAT HIS VOICE UP. Idk how to put this but said rasp makes his voice more human in a sense?? like, makes everything he sings very visceral and it's genuinely so addictive too. I remember listening to the chorus of Foreshadow for the first time and I was gagged. And the thing is, the rasp doesn't limit him when it comes to genres, like when he goes ""but I'm yours tonight"" in Criminal Love and ""now you're in my blood"" in Moonstruck, you can feel the two very different energies of roughness and softness and I think that's commendable. Plus, his slight aussie accent when he sings is everything to me, his cadence and flow, they set him apart in the most endearing way possible.
* Sunghoon: Sunghoon has a very clear and directed voice, almost as if he was born with an innate equaliser and it's so effective in that as a listener you can feel him singing *to* you. While all the enha members are very well at falsettos, there's just something about Sunghoon's falsettos that makes me ascend, especially his post chorus in Lucifer? It tickles the right part of my brain. His versatility is also a strength. You're telling me his is the voice that sings the cunty ass prechorus of bite me AND the one that sings the start of the second verse of Moonstruck? The switchup is insane, and that is an understatement. Hoon's voice has this cinematic effect, like take the prechorus of Given-Take for instance, the kind that leaves an impression and I think that's why despite having so less lines (belift is so stuck up for not giving him enough lines istg) his are the ones that go viral most of the time. His delivery is top notch, take Sweet Venom for example, he had a grand total of one line in the whole song, but it was still very hooking, especially the way he dragged out the ""had"" in ""I would give up heaven if I had to"" or his breathy vocal in XO, ""Can I kiss you, can I hug you?"" His vocals are flawless, much like him and I'm dying on this hill
* Sunoo: Sunoo's voice is like the night. It has delectable cooler undertones which naturally give an intimate tinge to whatever he sings. Also this might be arguable but I think he has a voice that complements every other member's perfectly, he's kind of like the O+ of the group (idk how else to exemplify sorry). There's also a sense of freeness??? in the way he sings that's just so delightful to hear, think of him ending the second verse of Scream. His lower registers, from the first verse of Fatal Trouble to the intro of Criminal Love are so velvety. His bridge with Heeseung in Orange Flower? immaculate. To add to that, it's almost as if his voice has a story-telling quality, kind of like those cheeky unreliable narrators. As a whole in the group I feel like his voice sets a very strong base/foundation. But as much as I've stressed on how exceptional his lower baritones are, his high notes are no joke either. On top of that, I'd say he's also extremely good at delivering the right emotion with just the right amount of energy.  Edit: OH MY GOD I FORGOT TO MENTION HIS LAYERED SIREN VOCAL IN SACRIFICE (EAT ME UP), when I first listened to semu, I thought it was Heeseung's voice, so imagine my pleasant surprise when I found out it was actually Sunoo's! I feel like that's the epitomic testament to his compass of emotive insertion when it comes to amending the little things that are very naturally specific to your chords. Absolutely insane.
* Jungwon: Jungwonnnn I think has a natural vibrato to his tone and it's so pleasant to the ears. His voice goes in tandem with the fiery, more energetic concepts, like his intro in Future Perfect (Pass The Mic), that was a whole other level of iconic, and his start of verse 1 in Fatal Trouble. I feel like everytime he's the one starting a song, the bar for energy has already been set very high you just know it's going to be a banger. So far you'd think high energy concepts are his forte but then you listen to Moonstruck and you're like ???? bitch??? His intro tease in Moonstruck is one of the most scrumptious vocals I've heard if not the most. Teeth, for one, is a song that allows him to flex his vocal strengths amazingly, and even his part in Sacrifice (Eat Me Up), the second verse (So dangerous...) is so *edible*, do you get what I mean. All that said, I think it's safe to compare his voice to an exotic animal, it's gonna grab everyone's attention no matter where it goes, but it's glory in its natural habitat is unparalleled.
* Niki: Ah RIki, my sweet summer child. For someone whose voice has transitioned through the stages of puberty from lighter registers to a deeper baritone, he has developed his range so well. His collab with Taemin at GDA 2024, where they performed Guilty showcased his vocal strength marvelously. I feel like out of all the members, his is the progress that we've all seen occur in real time (that isn't to say that he was in any way lacking) and that's what makes his current vocal high feel so good. To me, his voice has a very calming, comforting quality. His lower registers, much like Sunoo's are so grounding in the sense that you feel their notes vibrate through your body, that could be just me though. For example, his second verse in Fatal Trouble was so???? not to mention the transition from that to his falsetto in the post chorus of the same song. Crazy. The prechorus of Moonstruck is also a commendable example of the extent of softness he can mould his voice into. Even when he raps, he's got this certain cadence and tinge to his voice while delivering the lines that makes it instantly recognisable and no matter how much you hold it back, you are going to end up bopping along.

ah welp. that was long.

I'm sorry I just needed to get it all out into the open space because, and this isn't even an overstatement, Enhypen truly is one of its kind, be it musically, in terms of stage presence, dance, every member's individual influence and impact (one of these days, I'm gonna make separate posts for each). They've got it all. Kinghypen, truly.

Anddd I used most examples from Romance Untold and Memorabilia because they're my babies. Anyway I'm always up for discussions about our 7 so if yall ever wanna, dont hesitate to hmu.

Edit: Obviously I'm no music connaisseur and these are just my opinions, I'd love to hear from yall as well.

Enhypenthoughts,1iye8bd,2025-02-26 04:33:54,Kind of overwhelmed (new here),"I finished watching (inhaling) i-land about a week ago after I happened across their No Doubt MV, and I was so curious about their beginnings after watching the MV. I KNEW I'd be in trouble if I got to know their names, I *knew* it, and I couldn't stop myself 🤣

First, I'm sure watching i-land knowing who the final members were going to be was a different experience to people watching it in real time. My subconscious probably favored the final members, but I really did see how each one of them absolutely deserved to be named as members by the very end.

Going into i-land, I'd only heard of Ni-ki (of course). But getting to know how utterly sweet and humble he is really blew me away. His dancing skills and abilities are just..  Wow. I've actually found myself mesmerized by multiple videos of him dancing.

Before i-land I'd already started off really liking Heeseung (he's so talented it's just mind blowing, but he's also too hard on himself my gosh!! 😭) and Jungwon (unbelievable how mature and determined he's been from the get go)..but.. I swear I'd fight someone if they side-eyed Jay wrong now too. After watching him work his way out of his negative emotions into being able to make jokes about his ""R.A.S."" and then turn it completely around to being such an incredible leader... I LOVE him so much, he's a gem!! His depth and emotional growth pushed him so high for me.

Sunghoon's history as an ice skater impressed me, but his determination to become an idol floored me even more. He's sneaky with his humor too, it always catches me off guard. Jake's big smile could melt the coldest heart. And his accent and sweet nature really won me over. These two and their friendship since i-land made my heart so happy, I find myself with a big dumb grin on my face whenever I see them interact. I feel like these are the two members I don't know as well though. Is there content I could watch that would help?

Finally though.. Sunoo. I have laughed *non stop* at his sassiness and his cutely manipulative nature (I don't know how someone can be so adorable while trying so much to get their way, but he pulls it off every single time lol). I knew he'd be one of the chosen members at the end of i-land of course, but I was still on the edge of my seat and screaming at my TV by that point because he had me fully on his side..😅

Anyway.. I love them all! I'm really impressed with their music, their dedication to their craft, their dancing abilities, their relationships with each other, and how hard they work. But omg.. I do NOT have time to add all this into my life lol (I'm also ARMY, BTS has had a grip on me for 3.5 years, I don't even have enough time for them rofl). I'm doing it anyway, but I'm having to try to pace myself after i-land. And watching every MV multiple times.. lol.

I'm having a hard time picking a favorite song so far. Moonstruck is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life, and it's been on repeat, but all of the songs on their latest album are incredible!! In fact I haven't heard a skip yet from any of the albums I've heard. What are they putting in their music?? 😵‍💫

I'm so new I don't even know their nicknames yet. Do they have nicknames? Do they have individual accounts anywhere other than Weverse, or only group accounts? I'm trying to watch their content in order of release but it's so jumbled up and all over the place and I feel lost lol. Are there translator accounts or dedicated update accounts? I left Twitter for Bluesky and Reddit, I don't want to go back again for easy to find updates aaahahah!

Phew. I'm so tired but energized at the same time 😅 ",82,28
Enhypenthoughts,1iyexkr,2025-02-26 05:11:30,A some observation about members names and profiles on weverse,"I don't know if anyone remembers that initially all the members' names on their profiles where they write to fans (not on the profiles that are displayed in moments) were in Korean.

Since then, some members have changed their nicknames.

Jungwon, Sunoo, and Heeseung are the ones who regularly change their nicknames to a variety of options.

Jake and Sunghoon have changed their nicknames several times, but less often than Jungwon, Sunoo, and Heeseung.

 In addition, Jake uses the English spelling of his name for regular use. And Sunghoon always goes back to the Korean spelling of his name.

Jay also changed the Korean spelling to English and I don't remember him changing his nickname again.

Ni-ki seems to have never changed his name, continuing to use the original Korean version.

There is also another interesting point to note. All members, some more often, some less often comment on fans' posts with memes or just different fan posts, but Ni-ki always comments only on fans' responses under his own post.",44,5

Enhypenthoughts,1ixqfij,2025-02-25 09:40:23,ot6 agenda,"So. after being on enhypen twitter for a while and having been a kpop stan for an incredibly long time i have come to the conclusion that engenes are probably the worst type of fandom an artist could possibly have. i have never seen a fandom and a company so hell bent on pushing their ot6 agenda. it honestly surprises me because sunoo is the least problematic member like i have yet to see him do something thats like even remotely a little bit controversial.  
  
(i started stanning enhypen cause i came across their music and i really liked it when i compared it to other bg music i listen to. they were my top 2 artist for like 2 years straight before i even decided to get into them like actually at the start of 2023 and i didnt even know of the controversies surrounding sunoo and the members relationship)  
  
my point is that sunoo does not get any exposure by belift and it almost seems like the company is hell bent on sabotaging his career. everytime sunoo gets a praise tweet other enhypen fans start attacking sunoo for god knows what reason. hes the member with the least brand deals and has no solo/duo brand deals despite having like the highest brand reputation last to last month and constantly being top2/top3 brand reputation wise. whenever a baragi brings this up people start attacking them and everytime a fanwar happens it seems that the punching bag is always sunoo and sunoo fans. i have never seen a fandom hate a member just for existing. and do not get me started on the sexuality discourses. sunoo does not even get a lot of lines despite having like the best vocal range.   
  
it also seems that belift is also hell bent on pushing this ot6 agenda and everytime stuff like this clearly happens out in the open i never see big accounts or so called ot7 engenes talk about it.

Enhypenthoughts,1iwl2yt,2025-02-23 22:28:37,I don't think I-Land was THAT bad,"First of all I know its 2025 and its time to let it go. And I dont want to say it was good on their mental health I'd be the first to say some of them got trauma (especially Heesung) from being there but compared to other Survival Shows, it was more humane. Maybe because there were not as many participants as in other Shows which came out the last few years. I-Land had a lot of participants but it was enough that you can learn a lot about nearly everyone, and you really felt for the ones that got eliminated.

I don't know why I wrote this to be honest, today I watched a video about Starlight Boys which was well not good lets say, and saw a clip of I-Land and I just thought of this. Hope this is not outrageous to say",43,22

Enhypenthoughts,1iuis6m,2025-02-21 05:47:27,Reading old posts here that have been proven wrong is so crazy.,"There are posts here with huge upvotes that Sunoo was being mistreated because he didn't have a cover yet. Guess what? It turns out he was quietly working on it behind the scenes but so many of ya'll were insisting he was being bullied by Belift. Jake said it takes a year to really plan, decide, record, and film everything depending on the member too.


There are also comments that Belift was mistreating Jake and Sunoo for not sending them to variety shows. Shortly after, it was announced they're scheduled for Zip Daesung and Jake got BTOB. These things take **months** to book so no, it wasn't whiny fans who made this happen.


There were also comments about ""Why is it always Jay who gets a collab?"" It turns out, Heeseung and Jake were actually working with Flo Rida in secret 😭 


I'm seeing similar comments again about why doesn't Sunghoon or Ni-Ki have a cover yet? Maybe shut it this time because it's probably happening behind the scenes????


During award show season, people were complaining why does Ni-Ki always get the dance breaks? **People could just not wait** and started complaining so noisily. It turns out, all members had their moment and some special stages or center dances.


Reading old posts here is crazy because so many Engenes were sure Belift hated Enhypen, wanted to sabotage them, ruin them, humble them, and torture them only to show that they had opportunities in secret lined up 😭 By the time these ""surprises"" were released, fans would find another thing to be unhappy about.


I'm not saying Belft holds emotional affection for Enha but I think we can trust that it's in their best business to promote Enhypen and plan things out for them.


The narrative that Belift doesn't want Enha to get big is stupid because they're not in SM. In HYBE, it's literally every group's goal to go global as inspired by BTS. Belift isn't going to sabotage Enha because they're ""scared"" of Enha becoming bigger so please stfu. This isn't SM or YG.


Maybe we can all learn to wait before whining next time.

I wanna see Enhypen badly, and I want WTL to be my first kpop concert (yes, I’m one of the older Engenes) so to make up for this I decided to see them in Bangkok on June 21st instead and am initially thinking of securing plane tickets first — from Canada to Philippines then to Thailand (doing this so I can get my lightstick back home in Manila)

Would you guys know how and when can I purchase the concert ticket? Is it better to secure the concert tickets first? I just don’t want my effort of flying all the way across the globe go to waste (and this is going to be EXPENSIVE af 😭) I just need some guidelines, I’m seeing stuff from Klook but prices aren’t up on their website yet

I genuinely had no idea ENHYPEN made a soundtrack for a Kdrama or that “I Need The Light” was a soundtrack, or that Sunghoon was in a Kdrama.

I want to clarify some things before I get into my question. I don't mean to be disrespectful towards anyone, I'm not a fan of the band, my girlfriend however is. 

so, my girlfriend has been obsessed with k-pop and especially with ENHYPEN lately. I've never been a fan of k-pop myself, but I gladly listen to her fangirl moments and watch videos of ENHYPEN with her a lot just to know what she's interested in. 

today, she mentioned that she would like to buy a lightstick (at first, when I heard this term I couldn't even imagine what it meant to be honest) 
and when me and our friends asked her what it was, she showed us the official lightsticks of the band. 
we honestly did not understand what the hype was about. all we, non-fans, saw was a stick with a light bulb. she told us what the price of it was, and we were even more confused than before. how could a stick with a light bulb cost so much? 

she explained that it has different colors and fans bring them to concerts. she also said that it's a must have for a fan and that it's necessary for concerts. i

me and my friend tried to look it up to have an idea what it was for, to be able to understand why it's so important. I'm still a little bit confused about how to use it, or something like that.

so, my question is that are the lightsticks really a must have or are they just fun things to have if you want to?

again, I didn't mean to be disrespectful to anyone here or to the band, I'm just really confused about it, but I want to support my girlfriend in her obsession with the band. 

thank you in advance if anyone takes the time to read this post and reply.

I know that he also came in first place in I-LAND, which could be the reason why, as they just give whoever won the show leader position which could explain it.

But I’m not sure, did Jungwon become leader because he came in first place or was it because he could actually lead the group the best and was most fit to be leader despite being 16 and the second youngest? 

Because to me, 16 is so incredibly young to be a leader and with the information that he came in first place it made me wonder how he became leader.

I’m not questioning his leadership or maturity or anything like that, but just genuinely curious for the process which he was picked to be leader.",43,25

This just proves that we should stop doubting our ability to win award shows. When we come together, we’re powerful!

Enhypenthoughts,1inh20b,2025-02-12 03:55:02,ENHYPEN deserves a better fandom,"I just wanna get this off my chest. I started ulting ENHYPEN around Thanksgiving last year. I’ve never really ulted a group before, so I didn’t have any expectations about what the fandom vibe would be like. But now that I’ve been an ENGENE for a bit, I’m realizing… this fandom is a mess.

Like, I knew akgaes, solo stans, OT6s, etc., existed in every fandom, but why does it feel like ENHYPEN is cursed with these types of people? If you didn’t know, there’s a voting thing happening right now for ENHYPEN. It’s for the D-Award Popular Boy Group on UPICK, and ENHYPEN is nominated. We’re currently in 2nd place and the voting ends in a day.

BUT here’s the drama: There was also a category for Individual Boy, and NI-KI solo stans went hard on that (maybe some ENGENEs too, but mostly NI-KI stans). I follow a lot of voting groups on Twitter/X, and they’ve all been saying to focus on the Boy Group category since it’s for the whole group and ENHYPEN is actually attending. The Individual Boy category ended yesterday, and NI-KI placed third. Now I’m seeing a ton of NI-KI voters mad at ENGENEs for not voting with them.

Like?? We were literally trying to secure a win for the whole group, not just individual members. And let’s be real—the gap from third to second in NI-KI’s category was more than 100 million votes. The ENHYPEN voting team isn’t big enough to handle multiple categories at once. Focusing on the group vote was just smarter. But now, NI-KI stans are pissed because of all the votes they put into the individual category, acting like ENGENEs are the villains.

And yeah, a lot of ENGENEs were under NI-KI vote threads, saying it’d be better to focus on the group category, but what did we get in response? “Leave, NI-KI deserves it more than the group.” Like??? ENHYPEN is seven members last time I checked.

I love all the members, but seeing this kind of behavior in the fandom is disgusting. I’m sorry for this long-ass rant, but I just needed to get it off my chest. I’m literally waiting for Avatar Aang to melt out of that iceberg and unite us all because ENHYPEN deserves a better fandom. 😭

Edit: I know there are amazing ENGENES who work hard everyday for the boys, but these type of people overshadow them

Edit 2: Just came back from twitter to seeing nk solo stans stating they will never vote for a group vote ever again due to a voting teams poorly worded tweet (which they apologized and deleted the tweet btw). to reiterate, i am NOT talking about nk fans/bias, im talking about the solo stans who sabotages the group/other group members :)",81,71

Sorry for all the stuff im gonna say, i don't mean to offense anyone (except Hybe and Belift lol im mad at them), i just let it all out so it's kinda just complaining but yk it's the reality and im so tired of that so yeah.

First, about the world tours : 3 tours and not a single date in Europe?? like bro, the world is not just Asia and USA. There are more than 2 continents. Let's hope they're gonna announce dates for late 2025 or 2026 🙏 (ofc #letenhypenrest but if we could at least have a date here at some point, we would be glad). Fr im so sad, i always wait and i don't even go to the other groups' concerts when they (finally) come here bc im not rich (i wanted to buy tickets for Kiss Of Life but 😭 i had to choose) and i keep my money in case Enha would come bc they are my ult and i don't want to miss it.

Secondly, the pop up stores. No real need to talk about that bc we have none. I want to go to one so bad but im not gonna go to the USA or to South Korea just to visit this.

Thirdly, the shipping costs of the albums and merch 💲💲💲. That's true everywhere, these taxes are high, even in the USA or anywhere else in the world except Asia (im talking about the kpop albums and korean merch in general tbh), but i feel like it's particularly high here. The album is at 15€ on Weverse and we have to pay from 10 to 20€ more for the shipping cost so that's just the double. The merch is already expensive so we can't really afford it. But yeah we bought it anyways bc.. bc yeah it's Enha. (I think u understand lol)

Lastly, i just want to talk about all the opportunities we don't get. The fansigns, the signed albums we can't buy bc they are only available in the USA or in Korea, the random stuff we can't do. And the fact that the members don't even know where Europe is: it's a literal continent! But yeah no hate, i just feel kinda bad about that.

So yeah all these things also apply to African engenes, South American engenes, and many others in the world 🫂 who don't get opportunities just bc their country is not well-known enough or just bc Belift ignores them. I just talk in the name of the European engenes as i am one of them and i kinda know what im talking about (i don't want to make assumptions for the other countries i wouldn't know). Yes Im well aware that the situation is probably even worse in some other countries, but what i don't understand is why Hybe seems to skip a whole continent.

However, lately they have seemed to start to notice that Europe exists 🫢. For example, TxT is gonna come. I haven't even bought tickets bc im still hoping for Enha but yeah. I hope their world tour will come here bc fr i want to see them.

End of the post, thanks for having read. I just wanted to talk about the situation bc im kinda tired of it and u can tell me in the comments what do u think or if i said something wrong u can correct me ofc maybe i mistook about the USA and Asia getting some more stuff but yeah. I think you understand what i wanted to say through this post. Btw sorry for all the mistakes, English 🇬🇧🇺🇸 is not my first language bc im 🇨🇵🇨🇵 lol so im sorry if what i said wasn't clear.

The last year was not easy for me but ever since getting into them more helped me mentally and how I think about things, normally I'd just go to school everyday and say I hate it there (I still do) but now I think even though I hate being there I just have to bite through and even if I don't want to study I will just do it. I also feel way happier. They as well as many other Idols always tell us how important your health is, before I always used to go to bed late and wake up tired and for years my eyes felt heavy but now I go to sleep at a normal time even on weekends, I care for my mental health and my looks and my eyes don't feel as heavy anymore.",28,0

Enhypenthoughts,1iipmud,2025-02-06 01:32:38,I love enhypen,"""Of course you love enhypen, if you didn't, you wouldn't write in this r/""

You're right. But I'm watching Highway 1009 and I just want to cry.

I've been with these little guys ever since iland and I never left their side. Tbh, at first, ENHA was just another group I listened to and had more groups I liked more at the time,  until my internship.

That experience was the worst thing in my life and I just wanted to rot in bed until the day I died but I knew I had to get up eventually, especially cause I'd be listening songs on the way there. 

That was the best part of the routine, go to the bus, turn off my brain and listen to music. And then music eventually became enhypen, more and more.

And thanks to the horrible time my internship was, enhypen became my safe haven. I knew they would respect me and motivate me to finish that hell when no one else did.

And watching Highway 1009, watching the memories we've made, makes me feel so grateful just for their existence and if it wasn't for that internship, I probably wouldn't be here now",71,6

Enhypenthoughts,1iiegu3,2025-02-05 17:47:11,Jay is so fine,"His visuals are on another level. Like, he’s got the whole package-main rapper, lead dancer and lead vocalist (definitely a hidden ace)He seriously deserves more recognition for how insanely talented he is.

His guitar skills, language skills, cooking skills-everything is precious. And I actually dream of becoming someone like him(I adore him so much)

And I really want to know if he prefers his hair slicked back cause him with his curly hair down is my roman empire duh. The stylists do him dirty ngl.I'll end up fighting with his hair stylist someday😭🙏

Last thing,I believe the online votes on biases are not true at all cause all the people I know are either Niki biased or jay biased then how come is his ranking this low? And most importantly he's being given more lines,he's performing almost in every award ceremony so recently his popularity has grown much according to the details. ",155,48

Enhypenthoughts,1ih23p0,2025-02-03 23:30:53,I think that Enhypen actually has one of the best relationships in Kpop.,"I used to be a fan of Enhypen throughout the early Iland days. I even participated in voting, and then after Tamed-Dashed I kind of fell off the Enhypen train for a long while.

During this time I heard a lot about the members not getting along, or their treatment of a particular member. I didn't really look more into it.

I stumbled across an XO award show performance, the one where Sunoo gave out flowers and drew me back into Enhypen with his absolute gorgeousness and beautiful stage presence. I watched basically every Enhypen related thing i could - enoclock, weverse lives, basically everything.

I have no idea why people say that Enhypen have a bad bond! What I love about Enhypen is that their bond seems actually very realistic. One thing I don't like about a lot of kpop groups is the 'gay' fanservice and over the top relationships, which people spin into their own sexualised fantasies.

This is coming from a gay person myself; it annoys me when relationships are whittled down into vague moments of 'tension' and touchiness. For me, the fetishisation of gay relationships have been used as fanservice for too long; and it weirds me out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. In Enhypen's relationships with each other, I see none of that. What I can see are close connections and bonds like best friends and brothers, not too much touchiness but a general sense of mutual bond and trust which marks most familial relationships. Just because the members are not as overly touchy with each other means nothing; you can see clearly from concerts and behind the scenes how much they actually do like each other.

Because Enhypen don't do the traditional fanservice stuff, I think many people have written off their friendship as non existent, which is honestly really stupid. Of course, there is a slight problem with this as their concept as slightly parasocial vampire boyfriends breeds a different kind of weird fan-idol relationship, but in terms of their own bonds I think they seem pretty good together. I think also as they were so young, with cameras shoved in faces constantly, their bonds are probably a lot more deeper and perhaps reminiscent of the physical familiarity fans are used to seeing off camera. Enhypen are a group that are very active on social media; and so it makes sense that they are aware of the weird stuff around and act accordingly to protect their own relationships with each other.

A note on Sunoo also - it frankly annoys me so much that people box this man in. Every time I see a video of Sunoo seeming more 'masculine', suddenly there are so many frankly disgusting sexual comments or stuff like 'sunoo is becoming more manly... im so glad.'

Sunoo, from the many videos I have watched, is happy with not fitting into the square social boundaries of 'femininity' and 'masculinity'. As he stated in one of his lives, for him, he is a 'man' because he is male, and he doesn't like being told to be 'traditionally masculine' because it isn't who he is. Sunoo is a very versatile idol who can fit many concepts and isn't afraid to be himself. He wants to be cute some days, more pretty on others, more mature on others. Fans keep trying to change him and box him into a certain category, and I simply don't get it. Many try and also comment on his sexuality, saying he needs to escape from the 'straight' members of Enhypen.

There are just so many things wrong with this idea. Do I think that Sunoo perhaps is not straight? Yes, from the media he has shared in the past on Weverse, and as a gay man myself, I think there is a high chance he is part of the LGBTQ+ community. Does it matter? No way. It isn't his personality - his potential sexuality means absolutely nothing. Just because can be fluid in his expression doesn't suddenly mean he is gay. Being Gay isnt a personality, it is simply just another part of you. And also, somehow saying that the other members are obviously straight again just feeds into this stereotype that there is a gay 'personality' and a straight 'personality'. And this is just stupid. Enhypen's sexuality is private and should mean nothing to you. It doesn't make them any better or worse as performers and people. Their relationship with each other isn't an object of fan fantasy, and I think that although Enhypen have escaped this on the most part, the side effect of this has been that people assume they have no bond. Which is honestly, really silly, if you watch any of their videos.",233,28

Sunoo's red sweater vest fit from no doubt 
basically any sunoo fit where he wears a sweater are my all time favs I love sweaters so much and basically SunSun both dress the most similarly to all the men in my family? So its familiar ig. I actually think a lot of my love of enhypens aesthetic is tied to nostalgia? My father and brothers wear sweaters a lot for example. And enhypen's sense of style is a lot more pared down compared to other kpop groups? Obvi they were expensive clothes that are fashionably put together but they also look a lot more like the average dude than other kpop groups? Or what i mean is like, if a regular dude wanted to use them as style inspo i feel like he could replicate their look fairly easily? 

Anyways, I'm waking up to the fact that Jake has my favorite style. I've been trying to resist his charms since enha debuted bc he's too iconic and it's too much for me but here we are. 

Jakes outfit for his appearance on BYOB or any of his leather jacket fits>> jake is the perfect middle between the more elegant aesthetic members like sunghoon and thr edgier aesthetic members like heeseung or niki. And as they always say, get you a man who can do both. Jakes outfits all have like, main character in a 90s movie vibes",154,36

However, it seems like I constantly come across people negatively commenting on enhypen. I’ve seen people say that they bully each other/ don’t get along. Some describe them as arrogant to the staff and outsiders and it’s got me really confused.

From the content that I’ve seen they seem just like a regular group of guys in their early 20s. They don’t partake in the classic K-pop skinship nor are they very emotional towards each other but that’s just how most people act. They actually seem to get along well and they make interesting (and more realistic?) content. Not only that but I’ve never seen them be unkind to others. 

To the ones that have been in this fandom for a while, why do you think they have this reputation? It’s sad to see an otherwise regular group of friends be this over-analized and criticized. ",72,37

Enhypenthoughts,1i3qi21,2025-01-17 21:55:20,Question for my Casual Fans,"Firstly, does this type of fan even exist amongst engenes? lol

I started following the boys during I-LAND and I became totally enamoured with Ni-ki and his talent and he’s remained my bias ever since. While I was somewhat engaged in the fandom during their debut era, I gradually drifted away for numerous reasons (discovered a different group, fell out of kpop, started uni, became an adult, etc). However, last year I found myself reconnecting with them. While I wouldn’t necessarily consider myself an engene during the past 3/4 years, I’ve consistently listened to their music because honestly, their discography is incredible and one of the strongest in the modern kpop scene.

That said, I’ve grown quite disillusioned with fandom culture. I spent my teenage years immersed in kpop stan culture (mostly on twitter) and frankly I feel like I’ve burned out on it.

Since seeing them live last year, my interest has steadily rekindled. But as an adult with other responsibilities, I find myself grappling with what it means to be a fan now. How does one stay engaged without the commitment of maintaining a fan account or religiously following every update on Weverse (which is such an overwhelming experience might I add, the daily notification count is insane). I’d love to stay somewhat informed and occasionally connect with other fans, but the all-consuming nature of fandom life feels completely at odds with where I am now.

Are there others in this fandom who don't fit this archetype of a devoted hyper engaged fan? If so, how do you manage and where do you draw your boundaries? For me, I don't follow them on any social media except TikTok and on my personal Twitter that isn't kpop focused, and I am subscribed to their YouTube channel but only watch some of their videos on a very occasional basis. I've thought about making a separate kpop Twitter account to just follow some accounts and keep up to date, but that's about it.

(Also, if anyone is in their 20s, feels the same way, and would like to casually chat about the boys and is cool about it, I'd love to connect and make some engene friends!)",14,12

Enhypenthoughts,1i1herb,2025-01-14 22:47:21,Thoughts on Riki's older fanbase?,"I want to preface this by saying that I have absolutely no negative perceptions towards older fans. I’m older than Riki myself, and I do believe that music transcends age or demographics. Being a fan of something should never be confined to a certain stereotype since it's a universal experience.

That said, I’m aware that the discourse surrounding Riki, his age, and the way he’s perceived is quite divided across the internet. However, I find myself genuinely curious about people’s thoughts on his fanbase, particularly the older crowd. And when I say “older,” I mean old enough to be his mother, or even older than that.

For some context, last year before Enhypen had a concert in Japan, Riki arrived in the country earlier than the rest of the group. Misleadingly, several articles posting his solo airport appearance stated that he was in Tokyo for an event at the Gentle Monster store. This turned out to be false, but the narrative was already out there, so the following morning many fans believed he would appear at the store that day.

As a Riki bias who happened to live in Tokyo and was coincidentally near the Gentle Monster store, I decided to stop by to:  
a. See if he showed up  
b. Determine if the store staff had any clarity about the supposed “event” as there was no official information online.

So I go to the store, it's a random Sunday afternoon. The store is running business as usual and so it quickly became apparent that no event was taking place. However, there were already numerous engenes and fansites standing outside the store who looked like they've been waiting there for hours. This didn't surprise me. What surprised me was the older women (and I'm talking clearly older than Riki's mom), who were waiting. I think what unsettled me was when I saw one of their phone lockscreens as a revealing photo of Riki.

While everyone is, of course, entitled to spend their time as they wish, there was something profoundly strange about seeing these women dedicate their weekend to waiting for the sheer possibility of an 18 year old boy making an appearance.

I want to hear people's perspectives on this and whether my feelings are valid, or if I'm perhaps being too critical, as I think about this quite often and if I am being too critical, I would like to change my way of thinking to be less destructive.",40,31

Enhypenthoughts,1hwx3cw,2025-01-08 23:36:22,The Grip Fatal Trouble has on Me,"Fatal Trouble is a song that has transported me in ways that few musical compositions ever have. While I would not claim to be an expert on music theory or sonic architecture, there is an undeniable quality to this track that elevates it beyond anything Enhypen has released so far. It’s a piece of art that, simply put, demands more attention. In 2024, Fatal Trouble was my most-played song on Spotify, and it turns out I was in the top 0.01% of listeners. While that fact didn’t really surprise me (there are times when I’ve had this song on repeat for hours) it’s the way it continues to consume me that astonishes me. It has a cinematic quality, a sense of escape and reflection, a feeling of having just completed something monumental. Every listen feels like a journey, as though I’m on the cusp of something profound.

Listening to Fatal Trouble feels like stepping into the aftermath of a life altering experience. It’s as if I’ve just escaped from a dystopian world, and I’m now taking a moment to reflect on what I’ve lost, the love of my life, the place I once called home. The song carries weight, a sense of looking back with a mixture of grief, heartbreak, and the realization that nothing will ever be the same again. 

My particularly favourite part of this track that always scratches my brain in the best way possible is Heeseung’s hidden vocals, which I came across in this clip from Twitter (https://x.com/ihs\_heeseung/status/1789995150376157299). His siren voice in the second chorus (around 0:15 in the clip) is simply breathtaking. It’s a fleeting detail, yet it adds so much depth to the song, encapsulating the very essence of what makes Fatal Trouble so captivating. 

Then there is the choreography, which I would argue is their finest to date. Each movement seems not only purposeful but integral to the song’s emotional arc, especially the moment when they get down on their knees and quickly bring themselves back up, which reminds me of an almost ceremonial gesture that anchors the entire piece. The group circling Heeseung towards the end of the track sticks with me so hard, and I think it’s because it embodies the song’s very essence.

What ultimately makes Fatal Trouble so compelling, though, is its personal resonance. It’s expansive enough to feel universal, yet there’s an intimacy to it that makes it feel like it was crafted specifically for my own world. It creates space for my emotions, whatever they may be, and transforms them. 

I'm writing this because I often wonder if others experience this song the same way I do, and if it has consumed them as much as it has consumed me. I often see discussions on their more popular tracks, which is deserved and agreeable, but I just NEED to know if there are people out there who understand this song and its demands to be felt, fully and completely, every single time.",101,17

For the iland video, I was shocked that Jake had zero facial expressions. I was shocked because now, give him a part and he makes them remarkable. I cannot fathom how he is the same idol who made luna nova, I don't know you, bad, bad, bad etc. remarkable.

Now onto PD's reaction, the memorabilia album where he said that Enha is now carrying their albums with their vocals and not by the melody of the songs. He mentioned that Jake is his favorite vocalist but he never imagined that at some point of Enha's career, Jake will be his favorite vocalist in Enha (non-verbatim). Onto the KBS performance, he was so upset when Jake's center part was zoomed out because that is his favorite part of the performance. I just find it cute because like he said, he never would have imagined that Jake will be his favorite vocalist. 

I literally forgot how he wasn't good back then. Even his dancing like the one with Ateez' Mingi became viral because Jake danced so well. I love how he keeps on improving. Jake's growth as an idol is astounding.

Enhypenthoughts,1hsvfd7,2025-01-03 20:57:15,"""Let Me In"" - A Love Story Subverted","“Let Me In (20 Cube)” is the third song on Enhypen’s first EP, “Border: Day One” (2020), and on first listen, I almost wrote it off as a somewhat cheesy traditional love song from a K-pop idol group, making promises to their fans that “I’ll be your boyfriend.” They croon “I’ll give you my love” so sweetly in the post-chorus that I almost didn’t notice the difference in the second line, when instead they sing “I’ll give you my blood.” It’s a subtle switch from a profession of pure, innocent affection to a whispered promise of something more sinister, and a brilliant example of the way the group often portrays the alluring yet disquieting charm that embodies the vampire archetype. In this short piece, I’ll discuss the origin of the title and explore the way the motifs, tone, and lyrics of the song create a complex love story. 

I. Title

The title is a reference to the myth that a vampire cannot enter someone’s home unless they have been invited inside. It’s not clear where this originated from, as the oldest references to vampires in folklore don’t really mention this. It likely originates from the idea that vampires, being something undead or cursed, cannot enter sacred spaces like churches, just as they are repelled by crosses. And if one’s home is their refuge, their sacred castle, then vampires cannot cross the threshold unless the door is opened to them. As the paradigm evolved and vampires came to represent our deepest primal urges, unbridled passions, and carnal desires, to keep a vampire out was to resist temptation, and to allow them inside was to succumb to the seduction. 

Movie buffs may also recognize that the song shares the title with the 2010 romantic horror film, *Let Me In*, which was an English-language remake of the Swedish film titled *Let the Right One In*. Both films tell the story of an unhappy and lonely boy who slowly builds a connection with his new neighbor, a precocious young girl. Over the course of the film, we discover that she is a vampire who must feed on human blood to survive. I won’t reveal any more of the plot points, in case the premise interests anyone to seek the movie out, but the relationship between the two characters is the cornerstone of the movie. Ultimately, despite the supernatural horror elements that are featured in the movie, it’s actually quite sweet and intimate. We see their bond grow stronger, two lonely souls finding solace in each other’s company, even as her identity as a monster is revealed. 

II. Lyricism and motifs 

The plea to “let me in” has multiple meanings in the song. It is, of course, quite literally asking to be invited into your home, to be allowed to enter “your little castle,” as mentioned in the song. There is a recurrent motif in the song and accompanying music video of glass cases, the titular “cube,” that is described as “transparent, through the blue waves.” In the music video, the members are seen standing within this glass case, like some kind of exhibit in an aquarium. It’s an interesting visual representation of the thin, but very present, barrier that exists between them and “you,” a reminder of the difference between the human and the monster. They can see and hear you, but they cannot touch. And like the enclosure at a zoo, the barrier exists for your protection as well as for the creature within. The fact that it is made of glass is also a way to show the fragility of this barrier, and how easy it is to simply shatter the glass and allow them in.

“Let me in” can also be seen as an appeal to be allowed into your heart, to open yourself to the love that they have to give. They sing to you that together “we are like a moonlight,” the moon being another recurrent motif in Enhypen’s songs and visual language, seen in the lyrics of songs like “Moonstruck.” They are charming and flirtatious, smiling at you and declaring that “my heart likes you.” 

But there is a deeper, more disquieting question. “Let me in” could also be understood as a sly proposition by the singers to join them in eternal life, as they offer their blood to you and sing “I can be the one for you for good.” In essence, they ask the question, “will you shed your humanity for me and the love I am promising you?” Despite their acknowledgement that this could “shatter your perfection,” they still offer their outstretched hand and invite you into vampiredom. The love they offer is laced with venom. 

The bridge illustrates this dissonance in a lovely, poignant way, brought to life by the voices of Sunoo and Jake. The lyrics read “Shining blue might turn red/Baby, joy blooms in the pain.” Blue commonly represents innocence, serenity, and calm; it is the shining purity of both the love they feel and of you, the (human) recipient of this love. In contrast, red is the color of passion, desire, and rage, the shade of the ever-present bloodlust that haunts every vampire. There is a tone of regret in this part of the song, an understanding that this is a corruption, a corrosion of red into blue. If you accept their offer, you may change, shift, and evolve into something inhuman. But there is also a promise of joy, if you choose to accept. Every love story requires a leap of faith, and it is you as the listener who can choose whether you want to step off the ledge. 

III. Conclusion 

In all the ways that the group has engaged with the character of “you” (as their companion through thick and thin in songs like “Given-Taken” and “Scream,” as their savior in “Bite Me” or “Sacrifice,” or as a lover for whom they yearn so desperately, it consumes them, vividly illustrated in songs like “Fever” or “Lucifer”), this song is a unique approach to their relationship with you. The song is a beguiling mix of sweet and sinister, and underneath that shiny light pop glass veneer, there are layers in the lyricism and musicality that deepen its meaning and tie into overarching narratives of love, longing, and temptation present throughout Enhypen’s discography.

Enhypenthoughts,1hp3le3,2024-12-29 20:26:17,Q: Goyang member ment,Hi! Does anyone remember who thanked Enhypen’s creative director during WTL - Goyang for the new stage design and said that  he was having a hard year and cheered him on?

Enhypenthoughts,1holcv4,2024-12-29 02:58:21,is it really weird that I'm a Riki stan even though I'm five years older than him?,"so basically I got into enhypen a few months ago right around my 24th birthday through watching their performances and MV's and the first one to catch my eye was Riki. I felt really weird after I learned his age but I couldn't help having a crush on him HELP lol. this is my first time ever finding someone younger than me attractive and I feel like a disgusting cougar

i love enhypen's music and content in general but i feel like i should remove myself entirely from them in order not to be a weirdo? pls give advice",45,43
Enhypenthoughts,1ho5a5v,2024-12-28 14:05:07,How will be the Enhypen members in the Long run??(Not asking in a negative way),"Given that most of the 2nd and 3rd gen group members are diversifying to various ventures despite staying active, the 4th gen is slowly going in a mature direction. Enhypen, despite only four years since its debut the boys are steadily growing and continue to do so. 2025 is their best year to come, to be honest.

But, how will they take their career in the long run??, Heeseung will have his solo mixtape next year, what about other members, any K-drama acting roles, YouTube shows, etc...

What will the members be doing in the long run, actors, soloists, Social media influencers, own businesses, careers in the West??? Who do you envision in which direction, and why?? (Just speculations, please don't take it negatively)",44,19
Enhypenthoughts,1hnwotv,2024-12-28 04:23:54,So... When does everyone think En-o'clock will be back?,"I saw a tweet mentioning that they heard from someone that Enhypen have been filming for En-o'clock earlier this month, though that may have just been a fever dream. Considering Enhypen Kakkoii has already wrapped everyone's expecting the announcement to come in the next couple of weeks. Has anyone heard from the members about it? I'm getting antsy. I miss them so much, nothing in life gives me joy except Enhypen anymore /hj",40,18
Enhypenthoughts,1hngxtf,2024-12-27 16:13:23,Do you ever wonder how much the boys are paid?,"We don’t really have any metrics to measure their wealth. We know they have bought Prada (but probably have been gifted most of their collection), designer sunglasses, chocolate bars that cost 100,000 won, but we don’t REALLY know how much money they make. They don’t have houses or cars, which people usually use to measure wealth of idols. ",39,15

Enhypenthoughts,1hn1yaj,2024-12-27 01:08:46,Have you given or received any Enha-related gifts over the holidays?,"Hi, everyone! A belated Merry Christmas from me if you celebrate, and happy holidays to you all~ Since we’re well into the holiday season, I’m curious to hear about what kinds of gifts you’ve been giving or receiving from others. I kept my contributions Enha-related since this subreddit is for discussions about ENHYPEN, but please feel free to share anything you’d like regardless of that :)

To briefly explain my photos, I joined a group order for the first time this past month in order to get a bunch of Daydream albums with customized inclusions as gifts for friends and family members who are Engenes! Pic 1 is the albums that I wrapped up for my family, while Pics 2-3 show the album haul before I packaged everything up. I kept the Blue Noon album with the Yunki PCs for myself 🙈

I was also fortunate to receive some Enha albums that I had asked for. Pic 4 is an early gift that one of my friends got for me: an Engene version of the Manifesto: Day One album!! I forgot to take a picture of the inclusions, but I’m happy to announce that I got Jungwon and Ni-ki for my photocard pulls~

That’s enough about me, though—I’d love to know what kinds of things you’ve gotten or given away as gifts over the holidays??

Enhypenthoughts,1hmbi2s,2024-12-26 00:21:29,can someone please tell me where this is from? 😭🤲,i keep seeing different shots of this in edits but i neeeeeeed to know the source 😩,119,8
Enhypenthoughts,1hmbb4m,2024-12-26 00:10:39,enhypen insta accounts ?,"there are these accounts on Instagram that some fans believe are owned by enhypen whilst alot believe are owned by fans they haven’t been confirmed by enhypen themselves and haven’t been confirmed by belift/hybe as theirs.

they started popping up during the enhypen drama series happening and I thought they were just related to that and would be deleted soon after but they haven’t been deleted and their are posts being made not regularly but here and their I thought these are fan owned accounts but I’m seeing pictures being posted on these accounts that I’d never seen before and when I try to reverse image search them nothing is found and some of their profile pictures are photos I haven’t seen before and can’t find again when reverse image searching.

I’m still skeptical obviously cause theirs been no confirmation by any trusted source but these accounts are maybe being kept secret ? they only have around 100k followers so I’m guessing barley any engenes know of these if any of yall wanna play detective please try to see what you can sum up or find at very least. 

I can’t be asked to write all users I’ll tell you Jake’s and the rest are in following of Jake

Enhypenthoughts,1hkp1wf,2024-12-23 15:37:54,Enhypens Jungwon,"i’m seeing so many articles and threats that toxic people (they can never be considered engenes) are leaving jungwon and there’s talk about him leaving the group. there’s a very low chance of this, almost nonexistent, but it’s so heartbreaking to see since jungwon has been and is innocent so this is so sad knowing that jungwon knows about all of this💔💔  this is an article i’ve seen but i honestly hope him and winter and everyone in enhypen don’t feel too discouraged 🫤 ",46,20

He recently had a cover of “Beautiful” but Crush and it was not promoted. I only found out coz i went to youtube to see if any enoclock was uploaded (bring it back😔). Anyways this is just a rant but i honestly love all of Enhypen and sunoo is just my little precious pocket pookie😋😋💗,175,22
Enhypenthoughts,1hj6p6r,2024-12-21 10:49:41,BTHB Sunoo's lil head bang,"I'm a new engene and I am all over BTHB. I watched the MV and I'm floored. There's a lot of craziness that scrumptiously matched the song which is about jealousy. I also watched their performance and I really, really, really liked Sunoo's lil head bang at his part on ""No, it ain't my fault, ain't my fault"" and ""Isanghae sileunde"" with the arm movement. I noticed that the other members didn't do this head bang even in the dance practice. I think it's really a stylistic detail that catches the spiraling madness in that part of the lyrics, it's a huge earworm I can't get if off my head. ",52,2
